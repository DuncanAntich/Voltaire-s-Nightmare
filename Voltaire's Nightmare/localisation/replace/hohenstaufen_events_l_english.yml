 parias_events.1.t: "Christians demand Paria"
 parias_events.1.d: "During the second half of the eleventh century, the Christian kings of Iberia would demand parias, or tributes, from the rulers of the Muslim taifas. The kings of Leon demanded tribute from Toledo, Badajoz, Seville, Granada, and Valencia, while the Counts of Barcelona demanded tribute from Zaragoza, Lerida, and Tortosa. Paria is now demanded of you and you are faced with the choice: to pay or not to pay?"

 parias_events.5.t: "Restoring a Paria"

 parias_events.6: "Paria Restored"
 parias_events.6.t: "Paria Restored"
 parias_events.6.d: "We have lost all. The Chrisitans declared a most terrible war after we rightfully did not pay them their demanded paria, but we lost. Now, we must pay again. Truly this is a shameful day for our people."

 parias_events.7.t: "Paria Restored"

 parias_events.9.t: "Muslim Victory In Paria War"
 parias_events.9.d: "The sky falls on us and the tower's walls crumble. Dark clouds bring hellfire onto us. It is a day of misery, a day of mocking. We have failed Christendom in every way. The heathens have renounced our right to demand tribute from them and proved it on the battlefield. Iberia shall burn in the fires of hell!"

 parias_events.10.t: "Paria Recieved"

A cursed day for the realm."
 almoravids_events.3.a: "Moroccan Scum!"
 almoravids_events.4: "Almoravid Invasion"
 almoravids_events.4.t: "Almoravid Invasion"
 almoravids_events.4.d: "They have set sail in the fleet of death and come across the sea. Gibraltar is lost! The Almoravids of Morocco, after helping Al-Andalus defeat the Christians, returned to their African dwellings. But yet here they are, and this time to fight us, not the infidels!

 almoravids_events.5.b: "We will fight!"
 theocracy.1.c: "A Merchant's Child"
 theocracy.1.d: "A Papal Favorite"
 purple_phoenix.1.d: "Though the Empire's prestige is unwavering, succession remains one of its greatest weaknesses. Ambitious nobles and prominent generals have ever been ready to attempt to seize the reins of Imperial power for themselves."
 flavor_gra.1.d: "In the name of Allah, the Most Gracious, the Most Merciful. The last jewel of al-Andalus, a beacon of learning, is now in infidel hands! As the Islamic world reels from this loss, Moorish refugees flock to the Muslim cities and courts of North Africa and the Middle East, bringing with them knowledge, works by exceptional scholars like Abu al-Walid ibn Rushd, Abu al-Qasim al-Zahrawi and Abu Bakr ibn Tufail. Inviting these refugees to $COUNTRY$ might provide an enormous boost to our own efforts in the fields of science and culture."
 tengri_events.51.d: "Fusing our Shamanic traditions with the wide range of Baltic beliefs we have come across have resulted in an ever-growing Pantheon. There is not a malady, disaster, or fate that hasn't got at least one deity to counteract it. This wide acceptance of differing spiritual traditions has led to an increasingly efficient handling of the religious conflicts between the subjects under our control, no matter what they believe."
 cultural_event.5.t: "Jousting Tournament"
 cultural_event.5.d: "We can feel it in the wind. Soon our equestrian elite will be taking to the field, as the chivalrous tradition plays out before the nobility of our nation. The world is changing, but for now: Let the Knights of $COUNTRY$ ride!"
 celestial_empire_events.1.d: "With the fall of [From.Capital.GetCapitalName] the last remnants of the Frankish Kingdom have been crushed. The crown's authority and the ancient Salic administration are now clearly seen as defunct concepts and the old Carolingian gentry as a class will have to evolve into something else or perish.\nThough the memory of the Kingdom will live for some time the [Root.GovernmentName] of [Root.GetName] will forever be remembered as the destroyers of the last [From.Monarch.GetTitle]."
 celestial_empire_events.3.t: "Gallicization"
 celestial_empire_events.3.d: "The [Root.Culture.GetName] people have increasingly come to resent the new French customs we have been introducing throughout our realm, from the court to the lowliest feudal lord. Due to this growing distrust of the alien impositions on our old traditions and norms some even openly question our right to rule."
 EVTNAME6163: "Heresy concerns clerics"
 EVTDESC6163: "Our Policy of tolerance to all faiths has led to some of our population deciding to embrace heretical beliefs."
 EVTOPTA6163: "I guess I shouldn't be surprised."
 religious_events.18.c: "We must send word to the Patriarchs."

 religious_events.18.m: "In the name of Jan Hus!"
 religious_events.18.n: "Be free in Christ."
 religious_events.18.o: "We must alert the Pope!"
 elections.722.d: "The strengthening of the Communia has forced $MONARCH$ to accept the election of a new Podestà. Both the Communia and the Signoria have put forward a new candidate."
 elections.723.d: "The unfortunate passing of $MONARCH$ forces us to hold a premature election. Both the Communia and the Signoria have put forward a new candidate."
 elections.722.a: "A Communia Candidate"
 elections.722.b: "A Signoria Candidate"
 elections.724.t: "Guelph-Ghibelline Allegiance"
 elections.724.d: "The conflicted interests of the Holy Roman Emperors and the Popes has shattered Italian politics into competing factions - the imperial Ghibellines, so named for a certain fortress which was once a local power center, and the religious Guelphs, named for the Welf dynasty. Even long after the Popes and Emperors resolved their differences and open warfare died down throughout the Italian peninsula, the cultural division would remain, forcing ambitious states to side with one set of interests or the other. Our [Root.Monarch.GetTitle] must choose which faction to cast [Root.Monarch.GetHerHis] lot with, and beware the consequences of the inevitably angered opposing faction."
 elections.724.a: "Side with the Guelphs"
 elections.724.b: "Side with the Ghibellines"
 hre_event.4.d: "For years now Imperial Authority over the Kingdom of Italy has been waning. Successive Emperors have failed to impose their will on the Italian states and large areas that are formally part of the Empire have been lost to republics and theocracies who reject the Empire's right to them.\nUnless Italy is firmly brought back into the Empire the states there may slip out of Imperial control forever."
 hre_event.4.a.tt: "Unless the number of Ghibelline rulers is greater than or equal to the number of Guelph rulers from 1490 until 1550 the states there are likely to leave the Empire. Passing Imperial Reforms and improving the Emperor's opinion with states will make them more likely to side with the Ghibellines."
 empire_of_china_in_name.1.t: "King of the Franks in Name"
 empire_of_china_in_name.1.d: "While we have achieved a general recognization as the new Kingdom of the Franks we have yet to earn the respect of the Frankish people. Our great reliance on foreigners in our armies and administration is putting the feudal authority of our dynasty in question.\nUnless we take measures to become a truly Frankish Kingdom we will remain a Kingdom in name only and will appear to have lost our feudal authority."
 empire_of_china_in_name.2.t: "Acceptance of the Franks"
 empire_of_china_in_name.2.d: "Our efforts to integrate the Franks in the state that rules them have born fruit and our claim to feudal authority is no longer in question due to lacking ties to the people themselves. Like many of the foreign conquerors Gaul has seen over the centuries our Kingdom may never come to be seen as truly Frankish in origin but it is truly a Kingdom of the Franks."
 empire_of_china_in_name.2.a: "For the Sons of Ascaric!"
 flavor_fra.EVTDESC9104: "[Root.Monarch.GetName] benefited from the outcome of the hundred year war. The virtual destruction of the feudal nobility enabled [Root.Heir.GetHerHim] to unite France more solidly under the royal authority and to promote and ally with the middle class."
 flavor_eng.EVTDESC9104: "The Hundred Years War was the last great medieval war. It was a war not just between kings, but lesser nobles were also able to pursue their own personal agendas while participating in the larger conflict. Future wars saw far less factionalism, at least on the scale found in medieval conflicts. The Hundred Years War was actually dozens of little wars and hundreds of battles and sieges that went on for over a century, between 1337 and 1453, until both sides were exhausted. While neither side won in any real sense, the end result was that while there were two kingdoms at the beginning of the war, there were two nations at the end of it."
 EVTDESC5083: "During the period 1050-1600, Italian siege engineers were highly sought after to teach the ways of the trace Italienne to the militaries of Europe. In most cases, these engineers had no national identity and simply worked for whoever could afford to pay them."
 #Institution Events
 institution_events.74.t: "Universities"
 institution_events.74.d: "Several universities claim to be the oldest in Europe, based on various criteria of measurement and semi-apocryphal records of when teaching began in their area. Regardless of who started first, by the middle of the 12th century organized didactic institutions existed across the Western world, from Bologna to Oxford to Paris. In $YEAR$, tutors and learned lecturers in theology, philosophy, classics, science, and other can be heard imparting their knowledge to new generations of young nobles, allowing for a dissemination of academic expertise around the continent. The phenomenon was not limited to Christian powers, as the Islamic world too had a long-established education system where some of the greatest minds of the Middle Ages tabulated their theories, taking influence from Asian and Indian expertise."
 institution_events.74.a: "This changes everything..."
 institution_events.74.a.tt: "Countries that have not yet fully §YEmbraced§! the §YUniversities§! Institution will receive an increasing technology cost penalty of §R1%§! per year up to at most §R50%§!."

 institution_events.75.t: "Rise of Guilds"
 institution_events.75.d: "With the rise of academic institutions, it is only natural that institutions of trade should abound as well, letting the bourgeoisie claim their own power alongside the landed gentry. Guilds were associations of merchants and craftsmen, centered around the structure of the City, often with the support of Royal decree. Growing out of post-conquest English law, guilds spread throughought Europe like wildfile in the twelfth and thirteenth century, with an explosion in $YEAR$. The structure of the guild could be replicated on even larger scales, with entire cities banding together into similar leagues of cooperation. The 'Hansa', first mentioned as such in 1267, was a particularly powerful association of traders which controlled Northern European mercantile life for centuries."

 institution_events.76.t: "Chivalry"
 institution_events.76.d: "Chivalric codes of knightly virtue have existed in some form for several centuries, but the 1300s saw them reach their height under such developments as the outbreak of the Hundred Years War. Off the battlefield, knights were encouraged to embody ideals of courtliness, service of the needy, piety, and fairness in competition. These ideals were encoded both in general social mores and in specific works of literature, which spread the romanticized concept of a knight far and wide in $YEAR$."

 institution_events.77.t: "Public Health Advances"
 institution_events.77.d: "A crisis has struck Eurasia, the likes of which have never been seen in human history. Priests and heathens, paupers and Emperors alike are mowed down by the thousands due to an invisible threat which looks like it may finally end the era of mankind. However, from the ashes, by the turn of $YEAR$ a newfound attention to public health has emerged. Drawing together the anatomic expertise of Islamic scholarship and Ancient Greek materialists, doctors roam the lands trying to minimize the damage and prevent further outbreaks of disease. Though they know nothing of the vectors which actually translate Bubonic Plague, certain strategies of quarantine and cleanliness have found currency in regions like Milan and saved them from apocalypse. These selfsame methods may pave the way for a better common weal at large in the years to come."

 institution_events.78.t: "Popular Theology"
 institution_events.78.d: "From the turmoil of Mongol invasions, the Hundred Years War, and the Black Death, new methods of approaching religion have emerged. The ball started rolling with figures like John Wycliffe and his Lollard heresy in England, but it wasn't until Jan Hus electrified the European continent that the true weight of populist theological movements was felt. With the contemporary clergy and laity of $YEAR$ both asking pointed questions about ancient traditions, the path lies open for more sophisticated religious hierarchies and secular reasoning. Even the stirrings of some larger reformation can be seen in the cries of street-preachers and God-inspired peasant armies."

 institution_events.79.t: "The Industrial Revolution"
 institution_events.79.d: "Steel, coal, great smokestacks and furnaces towering higher than the mightiest castle of the Middle Ages, or the richest palace of the Early Modern Era... in $YEAR$, building on Enlightenment scientism and continual revolutions in manufacturing technology, the world is embracing Industrialization. Rural populations flock to the cities to find work in new factories, while materiels are pumped out at an astonishing rate to support public and military demand. Not only has the landscape changed, but modes of thinking are shaped by the sudden presence of concrete and iron where pastoral vistas once abounded. Let the poets herald this marriage of mammon and muse!"

#Tributary Events
 tributary_events.1.d: "Our fiefdom relationship with [Root.Overlord.GetName] is certainly very loose but it has still opened up a world of opportunity for gifted officials and entrepreneurs. Many have come to regard [Root.Overlord.Capital.GetCapitalName] as the best career destination, and with every royal tax collection more set out to see the great [Root.Overlord.GetAdjective] capital.\nWhile there was some worry that this would be a drain on some of our state's most valued people, it does give us influence in the wider circle of countries around [Root.Overlord.GetName]. The few people that choose to return also have valuable experience that we can put to good use."
 tributary_events.1.b: "It is for the best of the [Root.GetAdjective] subjects."
 tributary_events.2.d: "As a part of the de jure [Root.Overlord.GetAdjective] sphere we are increasingly becoming part of the wider [Root.Overlord.GetAdjective] cultural world. The [Root.Overlord.Culture.GetName] royal dialect can be heard in the streets and even the high halls of [Root.Capital.GetCapitalName], and there is a growing awareness of our fiefdom in the [Root.Overlord.GovernmentName] of [Root.Overlord.GetName]."
 tributary_events.2.a: "A good way to make new foreign friends."
 tributary_events.4.t: "Growing Royal Influence"
 tributary_events.4.d: "While not every state deserves to be part of our fief network it is becoming increasingly clear that our influence is on the rise. Even countries where we have little, if any, direct power feel the need to actively position themselves along the guidelines we set for fiefs in our sphere. In many courts the [Root.Culture.GetName] language is seen now as the language of diplomacy and culture and our [Root.Monarch.GetTitle] figures as an authority in the minds of men and women far beyond our borders."
 tributary_events.5.t: "The [tributary_advanced_underling.GetAdjective] Tax Collection"
 tributary_events.5.d: "With the recent tax collection from [tributary_advanced_underling.GetName] we have not only received valuable gold, we have also discovered local innovations surpassing our own. It would perhaps be prudent to demand that the [tributary_advanced_underling.GetAdjective] supply us with more of their best and brightest so that we can make their methods ours."
 tributary_events.5.a: "The [Root.GovernmentName] can always use more Administrators."
 tributary_events.5.b: "Let us supply a manor directly in [Root.Capital.GetCapitalName]."
 tributary_events.5.c: "The [Root.GetAdjective] crown is more than capable of developing things on its own."
 tributary_events.6.t: "[Root.Overlord.GetAdjective] Adventurers"
 tributary_events.6.d: "An increased number of tax collections from [Root.Overlord.GetName] has led to the port of [tributary_trader_port.GetCapitalName] becoming the main point of entry for ships from our overlord. The province of [tributary_trader_port.GetName] has also started to attract greater number of [Root.Overlord.GetAdjective] traders and adventurers, further allowing the region to prosper.\nSome undoubtedly see it as a good way to avoid the watchful eye of the [Root.Overlord.GetAdjective] royal authorities, however. Encouraging these fortune seekers will likely prolong the economic boom of [tributary_trader_port.GetName] but it might still not be in our best interest."
 tributary_events.7.t: "Abuse of Fief Status"
 tributary_events.7.d: "It has come to our attention that the [tributary_criminal_country.Monarch.GetTitle] of [tributary_criminal_country.GetName] has been harboring a great number of criminals, pirates, and thieves, giving them a safe port against us. This is greatly harming our interests in the realm and has made us lose face to other fiefs as well as to our own court."
 tributary_events.8.t: "Royal Criminals"
 tributary_events.8.d: "[Root.Overlord.GetAdjective] officials are accusing us of harboring economic criminals and sheltering them from the rightful justice of the [Root.Overlord.GovernmentName]. According to the [Root.Overlord.GetAdjective] we are allowing them to continue their illegal activities inside the [Root.Overlord.GetAdjective] realm. Our overlord is now moving to crush these operations and have sent an ambassador to us demanding that we pay for it."
 tributary_events.9.t: "Administrating A Fief Network"
 tributary_events.9.d: "We have received complaints from the treasury that the great number of publican ambassadors that reach [Root.Capital.GetCapitalName] is overwhelming their resources. Receiving the dignitaries in a stately way and even taking care of the gifts they bring is growing to an ever larger and more complicated task, and some fear our diplomatic efforts will suffer for it in the short run."
 tributary_events.9.b: "We must expand the Treasury Department."
 tributary_events.10.d: "A royal mission is more than a journey to pay respect to the [Root.GetTributaryOverlord], it is also an opportunity for negotiation with the [Root.GovernmentName] of [Root.GetName]. Seeking to capitalize on this it seems competing noble houses in [ningbo_country.GetName] have taken to the habit of sending their own ambassadors to us, claiming to represent the [ningbo_country.Monarch.GetTitle] in order to gain advantages for themselves in the internal politics of [ningbo_country.GetName].\nThis time, however, two such missions arrived at the same time in [ningbo_province.GetName], which made their conflicts from home erupt into bloodshed."
 tributary_events.10.b: "Assign the two factions different Destinations."
 tributary_events.11.d: "We have received word from [Root.Overlord.GetName] that they are imposing restrictions on trade with our fiefdom due to our inability to police local factions from misusing the royal court for their own petty conflicts. Unless we act decisively this is likely to be a problem for years to come."
 tributary_events.13.t: "The Artisanal Goods of [exotic_tributary.GetName]"
 tributary_events.13.d: "Our court in [Root.Capital.GetCapitalName] marvels at the great number of artisanal goods brought by the tax collectors from [exotic_tributary.GetName]. Enterprising officials and merchants alike have taken note of how sought after these items are and deals are being formed already. If we don’t act quickly it seems all but certain a smuggling ring will be set up to bring more artisanal goods to the capital."
 tributary_events.14.d: "Ever since we started sending taxes to [Root.Overlord.GetName], the demand for the artisanal goods of our craftsmen have been rather high in [Root.Overlord.Capital.GetCapitalName]. This has lead to the growth of a small trade network, which while not entirely legal, has enriched many [Root.Overlord.GetAdjective] officials and entrepreneuring [Root.GetAdjective] merchants.\nHaving discovered the size of the operation the [Root.Overlord.GetAdjective] [Root.Overlord.Monarch.GetTitle] has now imposed much stricter regulations to stop what [Root.Overlord.Monarch.GetSheHe] considers to be illegal smuggling. Where there is demand it is hard to stop people from trying to make a profit, however..."
 tributary_events.15.d: "It seems the arrival of our representatives in [Root.Overlord.Capital.GetCapitalName] was quite favorably received. The artisanal goods our emissaries brought have lead to an increasing demand for [Root.GetAdjective] products.

 tributary_events.24.d: "By paying taxes to the [Root.Overlord.Monarch.GetTitle] of [Root.Overlord.GetName] we are part of the [Root.Overlord.GetAdjective] realm and people can travel freely between our lands. Among those that make good use of this opportunity are fortune seekers and adventurers from all over the region.\nThese people have skills, experience and a background unlike most in our own realm and could make a valuable contribution to our cause."

Since they are rendering us an important service in weakening our adversary, perhaps we should support them by sending a military mission, comprised of experienced military leaders and experts, for the duration of the conflict. Supporting them with troops or monetary support, if we can spare it, would also go a long way to securing our rival's defeat."

#Reformations
 hohenref_events.1.t: "The Cathar Heresy"
 hohenref_events.1.d: "Heresy is nothing new. In the patristic days of the Catholic church, there were earth-shattering controversies as idiosyncratic theologians formulated and spread controversial ways of exegesis. Since our divorce from the Byzantine rite, however, there has been a newfound attention to perceived abuses within the church. An inquisitory force dispatched to Occitania from the French Crown has discovered that such sentiments have finally reached a boiling point as a new faction labelling itself 'Cathar' - 'Pure' - has taken hold in $PROVINCENAME$. These Cathars are neo-Gnostics and believe that they can achieve 'perfection' by living in ascetic self-denial.\nThe Holy Father would be most displeased if we do not take action against their practices."
 hohenref_events.1.a: "Arrest them immediately!"
 hohenref_events.2.t: "The Waldensian Heresy"
 hohenref_events.2.d: "A wealthy merchant named Waldes in $PROVINCENAME$ has taken up the Cathar mantle by giving away all his possessions and embracing a life of 'perfection'. The only trouble is, he has organized many other townspeople to join him in a sort of rabble-rousing mission. Chanting their motto 'Lux Lucet In Tenebris', they are spreading the radical and dangerous idea that salvation will come most easily to those who live in Apostolic Poverty. They levy attacks directly against the Church, claiming its richness is an affront to scripture, and prattle on about camels traveling through needle-eyes.\nWith two different heresies now discovered in Southern France, the Holy Father will surely be apoplectic!"
 hohenref_events.2.a: "Have this Waldes re-educated."
 hohenref_events.3.t: "A Bosnian Church?"
 hohenref_events.3.d: "Seizing on rife unrest regarding the religious establishment, a faction within Bosnia has proposed a separation from both the Catholic and Orthodox churches, decrying the very notion of a state-influencing church as contrary to scriptural wisdom. Though most view them as another incarnation of the Bogomilist heresy, they deny the accusation, and insist that the truest path for Bosnia is to embrace our own church where no far-away powers can impose their will on us, and practitioners will restrict themselves to private matters of conscience."
 hohenref_events.3.a: "This sounds like a great idea."
 hohenref_events.3.b: "Church without power is no church!"
 hohenref_events.4.t: "The Fraticelli Heresy"
 hohenref_events.4.d: "Saint Francis is, of course, an eminently respected Catholic hero. However, discontent within the order has led a certain monk named Angelo Clareno to promote a new, extremist branch of 'Spiritual Franciscans' who advocate complete poverty and regard the established Church's wealth as damning. They claim any ecclesiastic figure who holds personal wealth forfeits his holy status, and encourage the poor masses into their hermetic lifestyle. Though some have attempted to reach a concordance with the Papacy, Clareno insists on open disobedience. This wouldn't be such a problem, if it wasn't spilling out right into our lands.\nThe Holy Father will be quite wroth if we let this heresy blossom on his doorstep."

Popular protests against the wealth, power, and pride of the clergy were frequent, and in times of disorder would express themselves in an extreme form. Church inquisitors have already tried to persecute these Lollards several times in the past, but friends in high places have protected them so far. Now, it seems they are getting out of control."

Regardless of where it came from, it's here. Black welts drawn straight from the maw of Hell cover infected citizens and soon lead them to almost certain death - the Greeks have taken to calling these vile inflamations 'buboes', while learned men around the continent try desparately to find an effective treatment. Our [Root.Monarch.GetTitle] has isolated [Root.Monarch.GetHerselfHimself] in the governmental palaces to avoid contracting the disease, but it seems to strike everywhere.

 HREMD3: "With an invasion of England now underway, lords and peasants from around the country flock to the [Root.Monarch.GetTitle] to offer any support they can muster. Our levies will be significantly higher than normal, giving us a fighting chance against our English foes."
 HREMA3: "Alea Iacta Est!"
 HREMT4: "End of the Conquest"
 HREMD4: "Our war for the English throne is over. Though it would be nice to maintain such a large retinue base, the fervor that led to such an outpouring of support has died with the signing of peace."
 HREMA4: "So be it"
 HREMT5: "An Heir for England"
 HREMD5: "[Root.Monarch.GetTitle] Eadweard's age and lack of an heir have become a concern amongst the nobles of the land, as many fear yet another disastrous series of incursions from Norsemen. One of the most powerful Earls in our lands is Hereweald, son of Godwin - tentatively designating him as our heir would ensure a strong Anglo-Saxon future for the realm, but the Duke of Normandy, whose court protected Eadward for 25 years, also considers himself the heir to England. Of course, appointing Hereweald would also spell the end of the most ancient and noble royal house of Wessex, the Cerdicingas."
 HREMA5: "Make Earl Hereweald heir apparent"
 HREMB5: "The house of Wessex will continue!"
 HREMC5: "Make Duke Guillaume heir apparent"
 HREMT6: "Edward Reassures Us"
 HREMD6: "It is known as truth throughout the land that Edward the Confessor promised his throne to Duke Guillaume. Some foreign foes, however, treacherously claim that this is a lie Guillaume concocted to justify a future invasion. Those doubts have been put to rest now, as Edward specifically and unequivocally reissued this promise to our state."
 HREMA6: "Great news"
 hrema6.tt: "We will peacefully form a Personal Union over them if all goes well."
 HREMT7: "Westminster Abbey"
 HREMD7: "The exact foundation date of the Abbey is disputed, with some claiming it dates back to the seventh century Bishop Mellitus and others pointing to the tenth century Saint Dunstan. Its beautiful carved corbels, arches, and statuettes are now in disrepair, and the monks often can't even spare candles to light up its lofty interior. Edward the Confessor started to fund a renovation project a few years ago in order to have a fitting tomb in which to be buried and to give the abbey the prestige it deserves, but supplies are now running short. The architects request one last lump sum of gold and promise the project will then be completed, adding yet another jewel to the Westminster area."
 HREMA7: "Finish building"
 HREMB7: "Cancel the renovations"
 HREMT8: "Norse Invasion!"
 HREMD8: "It is as we have feared. The death of the good King Eadweard has caused the vile Norwegian barbarian Haraldr 'Hardrada' - Hard Ruler - to invade our lands. Hardrada cites an agreement between the Viking pretender-kings Harthacnut and Magnus which stipulated if one were to die, the other would inherit his lands. Though Magnus himself died before he could launch an invasion of Harthacnut's English fiefs, Hardrada, as his successor, has taken up the job. Worst of all, traitorous Northumbrian lords have supported his endeavor as a way to seek revenge on [Root.Monarch.GetTitle] [Root.Monarch.GetName] for perceived slights. If we get our hands on these seditious devils, they should be executed on the spot for their treasonous betrayal of the Anglo-Saxon people."
 HREMA8: "Damn them!"
 HREMB8: "Damn them!"
 HREMT9: "Norse Invasion of England"
 HREMD9: "Haraldr Hardrada, King of Norway, has promised us great riches if we assist him in his bid for the English throne. Though his claim seems dubious, we could free ourselves from any nominal English control if we help this suppliant Viking, and perhaps become the next great power within the British Isles."
 HREMA9: "A perfect opportunity"
 HREMB9: "We would never betray England!"
 HREMT10: "Ascension of Ladislaus"
 HREMD10: "Ladislaus von Habsburg earned the monicker 'Posthumous' because he was born after the death of his father. Having inherited the title Archduke of Austria at such a young age, it was only sensible for the more powerful rulers of Styria to take over as nominal regent. Now, however, Ladislaus has come of age, and the Austrian nobles expect us to hand over the reins in full."
 HREMA10: "Extend the regency... permanently!"
 HREMB10: "His time to rule has come"
 HREMT11: "Unification of Switzerland"
 HREMD11: "The strength of the Confederacy throughout the Swiss region has finally led to the creation of a Swiss state. Already the different Cantons are binding together under a new constitution."
 HREMA11: "In Per Tuts!"
 HREMB11: "We are better off alone"
 HREMT12: "A New Canton"
 HREMD12: "A Swiss state has decided to abandon their errant ways and become a Canton! We should welcome them into the Confederacy with open arms."
 HREMA12: "In Per Tuts!"
 HREMT13: "Development of Dutch Identity"
 HREMD13: "With the late emergence of the Netherlands as a unified entity, the old cultural divisions are blurring. Thousands of people are beginning to see themselves not as Saxons or Hollanders but as the Dutch."
 HREMA13: "This can only be good for us"
 HREMT14: "Waldensian Massacre"
 HREMD14: "Europe has been scandalized by the recent massacre of Waldensians by a contingent of French troops. Even those who consider them heretics were shocked by stories of mass-murder and fathers being walked to death with the heads of their sons hung around their necks. A foreign poet has already written a dedicatory poem about the massacre, and much anger is directed at the French state."
 HREMA14: "I should've killed every last one of them!"
 HREMT15: "A Royal Marriage"
 HREMD15: "For many years Ostfriesland has been rocked by dynastic conflicts between the chiefdoms. We now have an opportunity to combine two of the most infamous historical rivals in a time of peace, setting the stage for the creation of a unified East Frisian county."
 HREMA15: "What's in a name?"
 HREMB15: "We should go our own way"
 HREMT16: "Independence of Groningen"
 HREMD16: "The Frisian city of Groningen has been slipping from foreign grasp steadily over the last few centuries. They now wish to formalize the matter and join the other states of West Frisia."
 HREMA16: "Very well"
 HREMB16: "An outrage!"
 HREMT17: "The Ernestine Duchies"
 HREMD17: "The fracturing of a dynasty's lands is sometimes an inevitability. Family members look to our holdings in Thuringia and want some part of it for themselves. Since our monarch has recently passed away, now would be a good time to give them what they want."
 HREMA17: "Make it so"
 HREMB17: "We should keep our lands united"
 ernestinett: "We will cede them the Thuringia Area"
 HREMT18: "Sale of Haigerloch"
 HREMD18: "We have recently heard rumors that the Habsburgs are considering the sale of Haigerloch. It would be a great boon to our fledgling state if we could secure the purchase for ourselves."
 HREMA18: "Pursue the matter."
 HREMB18: "Let it go."
 HREMT19: "Proposal of Land Sale"
 HREMD19: "The rulers of Hohenzollern have heard that we were considering to pawn off Haigerloch and have expressed interest in the deal. The area is insignificant to us, and we could earn a hefty price."
 HREMA19: "Sell it off."
 HREMB19: "It is better with us."
 HREMT20: "Haigerloch Purchase"
 HREMD20: "The Habsburgs have considered our offer and agreed to a deal! The surrounding titles are ours, all that is left is the payment."
 HREMA20: "Gott mit uns!"
 HREMT21: "Purchase Denied"
 HREMD21: "The Habsburgs have heard about our offer but evidently reconsidered their plan to sell. They have decided to keep the land."
 HREMA21: "There's always the hard way..."
 HREMT22: "The Fuggers"
 HREMD22: "The city of Augsburg is home to one of the most illustrious banker families in Europe - the Fuggers. In the late 15th century, they provided loans to the Habsburgs of Tirol and have thus been intertwined with the fate of greater Austria. If we officially invest them with some of our extraneous land, the benefits to administration would be great."
 HREMA22: "The Burgau is theirs."
 HREMB22: "Our land, our hands."
 HREMT25: "Clash of Kings"
 HREMD25: "We have honored the call of the True Faith by joining this war to decide the fate of Protestantism in the Empire. The battles, however, are the power-play of great Kingdoms and rich nobles with vast estates. On some level, trying to coordinate our own small levies within the larger structure of our sides' armies might be more of a hindrance than a benefit. We can establish peace now and retain the prestige of having honored our duty in the first place."
 HREMA25: "This is a relief."
 HREMB25: "We will fight to the end!"
 HREMT26: "New World Trade"
 HREMD26: "The discovery of the New World in 1492 has spurred colonial ventures from Iberia. Already the colonists have reported strange new crops and animals in this wild land, accompanied by a massive native population. As more colonial cities are established, transatlantic trade must enter Europe through its eastern ports - OUR ports."
 HREMA26: "Let the ducats flow!"
 HREMT27: "Expansion of New World Trade"
 HREMD27: "By now massive swathes of the serene American landscape have been annexed by European powers for their colonial ventures. As naval technology grows ever more advanced, the opportunities for trade profit have increased accordingly."
 HREMA27: "Let the ducats flow!"
 HREMT28: "Expansion of New World Trade"
 HREMD28: "The economic power of these New World possessions has utterly changed the face of Europe. We now have more money than ever before flowing into our ports from across the ocean."
 HREMA28: "Let the ducats flow!"
 HREMT29: "The [Root.GetAdjective] Succession"
 HREMD29: "The passing of our late monarch has raised questions over the rightful heir to the throne. The English claim the closest male relative is actually their own King, but this connection only works by passing through a female intermediary, which our nobility counters is against crown laws. While we have crowned a [Root.GetAdjective] successor, the English could use this as a pretext to invade our nation."
 HREMA29: "Let us hope they don't press the claim..."
 HREMT30: "Claims to [From.GetName]"
 HREMD30: "The passing of the late King of the Franks has raised questions over the rightful heir to the throne. They have crowned a [From.GetAdjective] pretender, but the the closest male relative is actually [Root.Monarch.GetTitle] [Root.Monarch.GetName]. The [From.GetAdjective] nobility has tried to object to our rightful inheritance by claiming the crown cannot pass through a female intermediary, but we can use this as a justification for invasion regardless."
 HREMA30: "We will fight for a century!"
 HREMB30: "There is no sense in pursuing it"
 HREMT31: "Hundred Years' War Victory"
 HREMD31: "The triumph of [Root.Monarch.GetTitle] [Root.Monarch.GetName] over the pretenders who sought to steal [Root.Monarch.GetHerHis] rightfully inherited throne has brought a great excitement to the country, as parades march through [Root.Capital.GetCapitalName] displaying the spoils of our hard-fought war. At last, peasants and nobles alike can put away their arms and the state can be shifted away from a total war ecnonomy to the management of our newly won titles."
 HREMA31: "For [Root.Monarch.GetTitle] and Country!"
 HREMT32: "End of the Hundred Years' War"
 HREMD32: "The extinction of the title for which we have so long fought brings with it the extinction of the great war's raison d'être. For now, peasants and nobles alike can put away their arms and the state can be shifted away from a total war ecnonomy to the management of our extant titles."

 HREMD38: "Unlicensed printers have been spreading rumors about our [Root.Monarch.GetTitle], some of which have seriously undermined the legitimacy of the state. One of our top advisors has warned the [Root.Monarch.GetTitle] about the issue and formulated a plan to combat these illegitimate sources. He requests the immediate implementation of the new statutes."
 HREMA38: "Don't be rude"
 HREMB38: "Don't be rude!"
 HREMC38: "YOU are fake news!"
 HREMT39: "Rosicrucians"
 HREMD39: "Legend holds that a wise doctor by the name Christian Rosenkreuz discovered certain ancient and esoteric secrets about the earth while studying deep in Islamic territory under the guidance of Sufi mystics.\nAt least, [Root.Monarch.GetName] always thought it was a mere legend... until this strange hooded mendicant showed up in his court demanding an audience. The man explained he was a representative of the secret Rosicrucian fraternal order founded by Rosenkreuz himself, and that [Root.Monarch.GetTitle] [Root.Monarch.GetName] was to be given an opportunity to prove his worth and join as one of the order's eight grandmasters.\nThe mysterious visitor insists the order must be kept a secret or great misfortunes will befall the [Root.Monarch.GetTitle], and further explains that joining the order demands an oath of bachelordom. The trials of entry may be quite costly, but the rewards - hidden knowledge unthinkable to the general public - will be great."
 HREMA39: "We have no time for such hoaxes"
 HREMB39: "Please, tell me more!"
 HREMT40: "The Test"
 HREMD40: "The hooded mystic has agreed to test [Root.Monarch.GetTitle] [Root.Monarch.GetName]'s mettle in the occult arts of alchemy and holistic medicine. Leading the [Root.Monarch.GetTitle] to a hidden chamber filled with bubbling elixirs and the desiccated corpses of fantastic beasts, he simply points a gnarled finger at the most dangerous looking potions without speaking a word."
 HREMA40: "Let's hope this doesn't explode..."
 HREMB40: "An easy task"
 HREMT41: "Success!"
 HREMD41: "Sweat dripping onto the table, [Root.Monarch.GetTitle] [Root.Monarch.GetName] has managed to stabilize the volatile panacea in the nick of time before disaster. The hooded onlooker smiles a grin of rotted teeth and reveals a red crucifix necklace from some hidden pocket in his robes. He beckons for [Root.Monarch.GetName] to bear the new symbol of his esoteric lineage."
 HREMA41: "For Rosenkreuz!"
 HREMB41: "I feel... younger"
 HREMT42: "Oath Betrayed"
 HREMD42: "By joining the most sacred and secret Rosicrucian order, we took an oath to be a lifelong bachelor. With our late marriage, the oath has been broken, and the Order is ready to excommunicate us for this outrageous transgression against its rules."
 HREMA42: "Beg the Order for forgiveness"
 HREMB42: "Goodbye [Root.Consort.GetName]"
 HREMT43: "Rosicrucian Secrets"
 HREMD43: "With the mystical Sufi knowledge made available to us by the Order, we can reap great rewards for our state. To what end should we put our occult expertise?"
 HREMA43: "Clairvoyance"
 HREMB43: "Draft of silver tongues"
 HREMC43: "Martial manna"
 HREMT44: "Rosicrucian Refugee"
 HREMD44: "A Rosicrucian practitioner has been driven from their homeland by chaotic instability. Knowing our [Root.Monarch.GetTitle] to be one of the eight followers of Rosenkreuz, they have appealed to our court for protection, offering to share their personal occult secrets and earn their place within the realm."
 HREMA44: "Great"
 HREMB44: "Let them find someone else"
 HREMT45: "A Shared Secret"
 HREMD45: "While our nations act in their own interests in most matters, a great secret held by [Root.Monarch.GetTitle] [Root.Monarch.GetName] is the knowledge that our neighboring head of state is also a member of the Rosicrucian order. Though we may meet on the battlefield, there will always be a hidden respect between us."
 HREMA45: "For Rozenkreuz"
 HREMT46: "Order Requests Assistance"
 HREMD46: "Our position as a member of the eight Rosicrucian masters has afforded us many benefits, but it also involves obligations. The order needs our assistance now, but in the interest of secrecy they cannot tell us what exactly they need our help for in the first place."
 HREMA46: "Very well"
 HREMT47: "Foreign Donation"

 HREMA47: "Great"
 HREMB47: "Split it with the Livonians"
 HREMT48: "The Sicilian Throne"
 HREMD48: "The late Friedrich II von Hohenstaufen, great Emperor that he was, left his legitimate children in control of the family's titles in Swabia and Tuscany, while the bastard Manfred received a mere administrative role in Sicily and the right of regency if an underaged ruler were to succeed. With Friedrich dead, the time has come to turn over the realm to its rightful heirs. Of course, with their powerbase being so far away from the verdant beaches of Southern Italy, it would be more than a small challenge for them to enforce their demands in the face of resistance..."
 HREMA48: "Turn over the title"
 HREMB48: "'Molon Labe', as the Greeks say"
 HREMT49: "The Sicilian Throne"
 HREMD49: "Our kinsman [From.Monarch.GetTitle] Friedrich of Sicily has regretfully died, leaving the throne vacant. His illegitimate son Manfred, previously acting as a local governor and royal administrator, has ignored our rightful agnatic claim to the throne and refused to turn over control of the realm. We must send an army down at once to claim what is ours by succession!"
 HREMA49: "War is the continuation of politics by other means..."
 HREMT50: "Sicilian Pretender!"
 HREMD50: "Friedrich II's illegitimate son Manfred has so far been a talented administrator to our Kingdom, having handed it over as promised upon the death of the good Emperor. We have just learned, however, that a false report of [Root.Monarch.GetName]'s death has spurred Manfred to crown himself King of Sicily in our stead! We must divert troops immediately to reclaim the title."
 HREMA50: "He will pay for his treachery"
 HREMT51: "Turks Raid Province!"
 HREMD51: "A small Turkish army has broken through the Byzantine Limes and wreaked havoc on the countryside. The local governor begs for the protection of the Imperial Army, and fears that the region may be lost entirely to the Turks without immediate attention."
 HREMA51: "Send resources"
 HREMB51: "Ignore it"
 HREMT52: "Turks Raid Province!"
 HREMD52: "The Turks have staged an incursion deep into our territories, slaughtering villages and carrying away great piles of loot. This theft of Imperial property is unconscionable, and our Stretegos recommends we divert a contingent of troops to guard the affected region."
 HREMA52: "Send resources"
 HREMB52: "Ignore it"
 HREMT53: "Turks Raid Coast!"
 HREMD53: "Turkish attacks on coastal lands in Anatolia have gotten out of control, with certain coastal forts being seized for weeks before local forces could drive out the heathen invaders. The local governor begs us to provide naval support, warning that entire coastal provinces could be lost to Turkish hands."
 HREMA53: "Send resources"
 HREMB53: "Ignore it"
 HREMT54: "Turks Raid Coast!"
 HREMD54: "A Turkish fleet has sallied out from the Levant to pester Byzantine shipping and coastal cities. Many citizens have even been stolen away as slaves. The local Strategos insists that the Imperial navy needs to turn their attention to the area and provide extra sailors."
 HREMA54: "Send resources"
 HREMB54: "Ignore it"
 HREMT55: "Turks Raid Supply Lines!"
 HREMD55: "The Turks have made a precision strike on our supply lines and roads, throwing the flow of administrative logistics into chaos. Local cities have personally requested the help of the Imperial court, claiming that with proper funding they will be better able to withstand the constant Turkish incursions."
 HREMA55: "Send resources"
 HREMB55: "Ignore it"
 HREMT56: "Turks Raid Supply Lines!"
 HREMD56: "The Turks have staged another incursion into our territories, this time harassing the administrative center of one of our Anatolian Themes. The local governor is begging us for help and warns that the entire Theme could fall into heathen hands without Imperial funds."
 HREMA56: "Send resources"
 HREMB56: "Ignore it"
 HREMT57: "The Battle of Manzikert"
 HREMD57: "Continued cat-and-mouse raids along the Byzantine-Seljuk border have invoked the ire of [Root.Monarch.GetTitle] [Root.Monarch.GetName], who has finally amassed a large army of Imperial troops, Varangians, and foreign mercenaries, even including a group of Turks. The great Seljuk Sultan, Alp Arslan, is rumored to likewise be the personal leader of the latest marauding Turkish army. In the narrow passage at Manzikert, the two great armies have finally met in an unavoidable engagement.\nThe frantic dance of horses and infantrymen has kicked a storm of dust into the air, and even the peripheral scouts are having trouble seeing how the battle proceeds..."
 HREMA57: "It seems one side is routing..."
 HREMT58: "Manzikert Lost!"
 HREMD58: "As the dust cleared, the full extent of the catastrophe became apparent. The cowardly 'mercenary' Franks had abandoned the battlefield, and the ancient Varangian Guard was wiped out entirely. The greatest nobles of the Byzantine Empire were either killed or captured, with the Turks demanding a ransom that would shake the Imperial coffers to the core. Though this defeat doesn't spell the wholesale collapse of our Empire, the way for further Turkish expansion into Anatolia now lies wide open."
 HREMA58: "Disastrous news"
 HREMT59: "Manzikert Won!"
 HREMD59: "As the dust cleared, the full extent of the victory became apparent. With the combined might of the various troop detachments, the much smaller Turkish force broke rank and fell into disorder. Alp Arslan was last seen riding headlong into a company of Varangians and is presumed dead. With a sizeable force wiped out and their leader killed in action, the Seljuk Empire has plunged almost immediately into civil war as various warlords vie for the now vacant throne. Though their borders are still secure, it seems the Turks will no longer be a bother to the true holy and Roman empire."
 HREMA59: "In Hoc Signo Vinces!"
 HREMT60: "The Turks Arrive"
 HREMD60: "Following the string of Byzantine defeats after Manzikert, the Seljuk Turks were content to annex the lands of the Armenians and made little attempt to break through the reinforced new Byzantine borders in central Anatolia. Now, however, internal politics have led the supreme Seljuk Shah to recognize a new state centered on Iconium for one of his relatives... the pretender has the gall to call it 'The Sultanate of Rum', stealing the rightful title of the Rhomaioi. The new Sultan has now directed his full attention at the complete conquest of Anatolia and the export of Islam to the Christian East."
 HREMA60: "God help us"
 HREMT61: "Province Falls!"
 HREMD61: "The occupation of $PROVINCENAME$ by the hostile invaders $CONTROLLERNAME$ has taken quite a toll on the local population. All resistance has collapsed, and the province is effectively lost to their power."
 HREMA61: "We will reconquer it later"
 HREMB61: "Tell them to hold out"
 HREMT62: "Komnenian Restoration"
 HREMD62: "With most of Anatolia lost, the Byzantine [Root.GovernmentName] is in a state of chaos, now dealing with attempted conquests by the Seljuks and ambitious Italian powers. The current [Root.Monarch.GetTitle]'s weakness has caused unrest throughout the heartlands, and a skilled general named Alexios Komnenos has proved his worth by putting down many rebellions and defending against hostile powers.\nThis Alexios seems to have near universal support, and abdicating in favor of him might be the only way to save Byzantium from further calamities. However, doing so might also open the [Root.GovernmentName] up to even more invasions under the pretext of monarchical illegitimacy."
 HREMA62: "God is with Alexios!"
 HREMB62: "God is with me!"
 HREMT63: "Rome Needs an Heir"
 HREMD63: "The age of the current Byzantine [Root.Monarch.GetTitle] and the lack of a legitimate heir has caused concern across the [Root.GovernmentName]. Many expect [Root.Monarch.GetName] to nominate a promising young noble to be their successor, establishing the wellsprings of a new powerful dynasty to lead the state to further glory."
 HREMA63: "A Doukid noble"
 HREMB63: "A Komnenid noble"
 HREMC63: "A court favorite"
 HREMDD63: "No it doesn't"
 HREMT64: "Switzerland"
 HREMD64: "Our supreme position within the Confederacy, and the general strength of our alliance throughout the Swiss region, has allowed us to end the era of Cantons and bring on the era of a semi-unified Swiss state. No more shall foreign powers subjugate us!"
 HREMA64: "In Per Tuts!"
 FBIT1: "Fall of the Babenbergs"
 FBID1: "For centuries the house of Babenberg has defended the empire's eastern frontier. The last Babenberg monarch, Friedrich II, tried to seize upon the Mongol invasion of Hungary by grabbing several border counties for himself. He underestimated the Hungarians' resolve, however, and was killed in the ensuing counterattack on the banks of the River Leitha in June of 1246.\nLeaving no male heirs behind, his titles became contested between the claims of his daughters Margarete and Gertrude. The former aligned herself with the Premyslids of Bohemia, while the latter betrayed her Premyslid connections for the Swabian margrave Hermann of Baden. The local nobility of Austria and Styria must decide whether to support the vagrant margrave who currently roams the land seeking recognition, or the more powerful kingdom to the north."

 FBIT3: "$PROVINCECAPITAL$ Seeks Hanseatic Status"
 FBID3: "With the rise of Guilds in the middle of the thirteenth century, a trade alliance formed between certain cities in Northern Germany which was to become known as 'the Hanseatic League'. Over the centuries, the league subsumed a large amount of cities across Northern Europe as a whole, ensuring cooperation and riches. The burghers of $PROVINCECAPITAL$ now seek to cash in on this lucrative opportunity, requesting our permission as sovereigns."

 FBIT4: "Last Will and Testament"
 FBID4: "The unfortunate passing of our monarch has created an interesting problem for the nation. The pious old fool adopted the robes of a monk and spent the last hours before death prostrated in prayer. Clearly this altered mental state led to the creation of such an outrageous Last Will and Testament - that the Leónese crown should be divided among all surviving children!\nThere are some who believe honoring these final wishes will strengthen our position against the Taifas, as several centralized states might be more effective than one thinly-stretched empire. At the same time, our siblings could simply plunge the realm into eternal civil war. Trying to nullify the content of the testament will be extremely unpopular, however, and undermine the legitimacy of our government."

This arrangement has satisfied the people for some time, but revolutionary sentiment now appears to sweep across the cities of Northern Italy.\nEgged on by the greedy burghers of our city, and citing trumped-up 'abuses' by [Root.Monarch.GetName], a mob has marched on the Episcopal Palace and demands that the [From.Monarch.GetTitle] step down.\n\nIf we give in to such rabble, it is unlikely they will do anything but force a Republican government on our glorious city-state."

 FBIB5: "Call the city guard!"
 FBIT6: "Guelphs and Ghibellines"
 FBID6: "The resolution of the Investiture Controversy did not totally calm relations between the Holy See and the Empire. Across the Italian Peninsula, local powers down to the level of individual cities threw themselves behind one faction or another, implicitly supporting them and fighting their neighbors until both sides forgot what the conflict was ever about.\nAt the seiege of Weinsberg in the early twelfth century, the Papal-aligned forces used 'Welf' as a rallying cry, while the Imperial-aligned forces used 'Wibellingen', the name of an important castle. From then on, the Italicized versions 'Guelph' and 'Ghibelline' would stick to each side.\nThough leaders would often switch back and forth between who they supported, neutrality was hardly an option in such a polarized environment."

 FBID8: "The deep devotion of the Avignon Catholiques in Avignon has awakened a desire for an independent state ruled by Popes of the Church. A large part of the population has expressed support for the idea of such an establishment and has now turned to $MONARCH$ for approval."
 FBIB8: "Avignon is rightfully theirs"
 FBIT10: "Rise of the Beyliks"
 FBID10: "With the rise of the Sultante of Rûm, we thought our trouble with Turkish invasions couldn't get any worse. Now, however, the Sultanate's hold over disparate warlords is declining, and several have begun to assert their independence as 'Beys'.\nWith such dedicated and highly-trained armies there is little we can do to stop them, but we may hope that they too descend into decadence over time."
 FBIA10: "Oh no no no..."
 fbia10.tt: "All non-Turkish provinces in Anatolia will be lost the the Beyliks"
 FBIT11: "Communal Outreach"
 FBID11: "Monastic life is often based around isolation, with some traditions even advocating the complete separation of brothers or sisters aside from specific meeting times. A prior has approached the [Root.Monarch.GetTitle] with a proposal for more outreach, though it is up to [Root.Monarch.GetTitle] [Root.Monarch.GetName] to decide where these attentions should be directed.\n\nThe monastic charter demands attention to other suffragan or parent houses, except in cases of severe sickness; but there is also an implicit obligation to attract righteous followers to become new monks or lay-servants."
 FBIA11: "Inter-monastic"
 FBIB11: "Local"
 FBIC11: "We are better off alone!"
 FBIT12: "Newly Arrived Converts"
 FBID12: "The child of a local noble has come to our gates asking for entry into the monastic life. A host of other potential monks have joined [Root.Monarch.GetHerHim] on [Root.Monarch.GetHerHis] journey, and they carry a significant endowment for the support of the monastery.\n\nHow can we put them to use?"
 FBIA12: "Give the noble a high position"
 FBIB12: "Make them first throw away their money"
 FBIC12: "Invest in our long-term stability"
 FBIT13: "A Lapsed Monk"
 FBID13: "One of our members has lapsed into sin! It was discovered that [Root.Monarch.GetSheHe] has been derelict in [Root.Monarch.GetHerHis] duties of prayer and labor, and may have even been cavorting with the local masses!\n\nWhat should be done about this outrageous breach of our monastic code?"
 FBIA13: "Let the breach slide"
 FBIB13: "Expell the weakling!"
 FBIC13: "Penance and rehabilitation"
 FBIT14: "Reforming Our Charter"
 FBID14: "A set of rules is the fundamental basis of life in an Abbey or Priory. Over time, however, these rules can become obsolete or neglected, prompting a series of reforms.\nIt is time that our monastery engaged in such a reformation - but we must choose which tradition to orient ourselves toward. Some favor the Cluniac model, while others find the Cistercian and Benedictine models more fitting to apostolic poverty."
 FBIA14: "A Cluniac charter"
 FBIB14: "A Cistercian charter"
 FBIC14: "A Benedictine charter"
 FBIT15: "Local Noble Seeks Blessing"
 FBID15: "In many cases, Abbacies were founded by a local noble who wanted to atone for their sins on the battlefield and in their daily life. Rich donations would allow for a community dedicated specifically to prayer for that individual's salvation - penintence by proxy. It was this practice that led to the foundation of Cluny by the Duke Guillaume of Aquitaine in AD 910.\nA powerful figure in the surrounding area has come to us requesting our help in that regard, and promises our role will not be forgotten."
 FBIA15: "We shall pray"
 FBIT16: "A New Abbey?"
 FBID16: "When one abbey gets too crowded for its own good, trusted monks will leave to found a new one, nominally subservient to the original. This is how Bernard's original abbey at Citeaux became a continent-spanning network of Cistercians - he had left his original home Molesme Abbey for its perceived vices.\nThough they do not complain of vices, some of our monks think it is time they established one such suffragan abbacy in the nearby woods."
 FBIA16: "Go forth"
 FBIT17: "Vows of Stability"
 FBID17: "Benedictine friars were required to take a vow of stability to ensure the Order's safety from decline. This anchored them to a specific foundation, but allowed them to wander the lands as a mendicant, preaching the good word and interacting with people from diverse backgrounds.\nMost recently, one of our mendicants has returned with a novel idea on how to increase our efficiency around the abbey."
 FBIA17: "Wonderful"
 FBIT18: "Finances Squandered"
 FBID18: "Those of a more Cluniac character contend that in our obsession with Apostolic poverty, our monastery is squandering its finances and potential. The monks already leave in cold, bare chambers, and if some improvements aren't made to the monastic grounds, these monks demand in inquisition from our parent house. One cannot help the poor or live a holy life if one is unable to move from sickness!"
 FBIA18: "Give in"
 FBIB18: "Worldly fools!"
 FBIT19: "Purists Threaten to Leave"
 FBID19: "The ultimate ideal of Apostolic poverty is being ignored, argue some of our monks with Cistercian sympathies. They have issued an ultimatum - reform our abbacy, or they will leave en masse to found their own! Clearly they fancy themselves latter-day successors to Bernard of Clairvaux."
 FBIA19: "Accomodate them"
 FBIB19: "We don't need them!"
 FBIT20: "Apostolic Duties Ignored"
 FBID20: "Those of a more Benedictine character in our abbacy think the [Root.Monarch.GetTitle] is lapsing into laziness. Meetings in the chapter house are not occurring on time, periods of silence are being ignored, and mistakes have even crept into the practice of Mass. What should be done about these Benedictine objections?"
 FBIA20: "Pray for forgiveness"
 FBIB20: "Who cares?"
 FBIT21: "Abbacy Dissolved"
 FBID21: "Since abandoning the Christian faith, it has not made sense to continue administering our monastery according to Christian traditions. As such, we must reorganize the state's properties into a more traditional theocratic government."
 FBIA21: "So be it"
 FBIT22: "Former Lala Seeks Appointment"
 FBID22: "Our former Lala, a trusted man who mentored us in our childhood, has come humbly requesting a position in the royal court. He offers his services at a discount, but it may give the wrong impression if we bow to his request - some may take it as favoritism or at best sentimentality.\n\nHow should we treat the Lala's plea?"
 FBIA22: "Make it so"
 FBIB22: "Pay him a stipend and send him away"
 FBIT23: "Court Divided"
 FBID23: "The peace viziers and war viziers are bitterly divided over what direction we should steer the state in. As usual, the pacifists urge us to focus on internal stability, reining in the many ethno-religious groups of our empire and ironing out problems with our administrative systems. The militarists denounce this as cowardice, and demand we focus on conquest, starting with rigorous training of our standing army."
 FBIA23: "Peace is the mark of a great ruler"
 FBIB23: "Conquest is the mark of a great ruler"
 FBIT24: "Bickering Viziers"
 FBID24: "The room is stuffy when you enter. Incense covers the grand table in faint clouds, and the lamps have burned down to the last drops of oil. It has been hours, but your viziers still have not made any progress.\n\nAt this point, only the words of the [Root.Monarch.GetTitle] can bring order back to this agenda meeting."
 FBIA24: "Side with the peace viziers"
 FBIB24: "Side with the Lalas"
 FBIC24: "Side with the war viziers"
 FBIT25: "Militant Sufi"
 FBID25: "A Sufi preacher has riled up some of the pastoral tribesmen with calls to jihad. The Sufis usually are content to live peaceful lives of mystical dhikr, but every once in a while someone like this man comes along - and the historical result has usually been a bloody revolution that overthrows the state.\n\nHow should we proceed? It may be dangerous to make the Sufi a martyr."
 FBIA25: "Arrest him"
 FBIB25: "Execute him!"
 FBIT26: "Conscription Issues"
 FBID26: "The war viziers complain that we could be more efficient in recruiting soldiers from our urban populations. Like Knights of the Christian West, richer soldiers can be assigned command positions and bring their own high-quality armor and weapons to the battlefield with them. It could be a great advantage to have such burgher-warriors fighting alongside more traditional tribal horsemen and professional janissaries."
 FBIA26: "Increase conscription"
 FBIB26: "Leave them to their trading"
 FBIT27: "The [Root.GetAdjective] State's Future"
 FBID27: "Our war and peace viziers seem to be able to agree on only one thing - that the time for fence-sitting has passed. They demand that we make clear the direction in which we plan to take our growing empire, as we cannot focus on everything at once. Ultimately, cuts will have to be made somwhere."
 FBIA27: "All to war!"
 FBIB27: "All to peace!"
 FBIT28: "Corrupt Viziers!"
 FBID28: "It has been brought to the [Root.Monarch.GetTitle]'s attention that certain viziers in the court are involved in corrupt dealings - blackmail, shakedowns, slush funds, favors, and other such criminal acts. The Lalas, loyal to each [Root.Monarch.GetTitle] from birth, are perhaps the only group we can trust within the stately apparatus.\n\nShould we task the Lalas with the duty of rooting out these corrupt officials?"
 FBIA28: "Mobilize the Lalas"
 FBIB28: "Shakedown is a dance, correct?"
 FBIT29: "Viziers Oppose War"
 FBID29: "Our ongoing war has caused much dismay among the court's viziers, who favor a more peaceful path for [Root.GetName]. The cost of the whole conflict has been quite taxing on a state coffers and local populations, and one particular vizier's call for peace is gaining increasing momentum within the capital. On the other hand, there are rumors that the pacifists' opponents are plotting to murder this vizier on the grounds of cowardice and treason. If we listen to the vizier's advice, those same judgments may reflect on us too."
 FBIA29: "Turn a blind eye"
 FBIB29: "Protect the vizier"
 FBIT30: "Viziers Support War"
 FBID30: "We are lucky to have the majority of court viziers support our ongoing war effort. They have been instrumental in keeping up support for the war in our capital city and among the aristocratic populations."
 FBIA30: "Inshallah!"
 FBIT31: "Swiss Merchant Dies"
 FBID31: "One of the Canton's richest merchants has died, leaving no legal heirs. We can repossess his lands and fortunes for the state, or allow them to be divided between the many dubious claimaints that have come out of the woodwork.\nThe latter path, while counterintuitive, could help bolster the fortunes of our Canton's other merchants, ultimately increasing our trade and tax revenues."
 FBIA31: "Let it go"
 FBIB31: "Seize his property"
 FBIT32: "Canton Attracts Speculators"
 FBID32: "The success of our Canton has piqued the interest of wise merchants from around the German region. A wave of immigrants have moved to the capital, bringing new industries and innovations with them. The local government can, however, intervene, and attempt to dictate exactly where these merchants are settled."
 FBIA32: "Settle the youngest"
 FBIB32: "Settle the richest"
 FBIC32: "Settle all of them"
 FBIT33: "For Switzerland!"
 FBID33: "As a canton, our state is tied to a Swiss identity. All our citizens are ready to make the ultimate sacrifice in defense of our freedom - and our late war may demand just that. Peasants and urban workers alike flock to local commanders offering to join the war effort."
 FBIA33: "In per tuts!"
 FBIT34: "War College?"
 FBID34: "The Swiss experiment with republicanism is unique within Europe. We can adorn our capital with a new war college, increasing both the city's prestige and its military capabilities. Some members of the Canton's ruling council, however, propose that we use our resources to instead strengthen our general infrastructure, which is especially important in a mountainous area."
 FBIA34: "Side with the minority"
 FBIB34: "Side with the majority"
 FBIT35: "Relics Discovered"
 FBID35: "The tomb of a local saint who died centuries ago in the early Carolingian period was recently discovered after being thought lost. His miraculous relics, such as an uncorrupted limb and holy dust, have been presented to the Canton's elders to much excitement from the citizenry.\n\nWe are left with the question of what to do with them. They could well serve to ease tensions with another Canton."
 FBIA35: "Send them to a neighbor"
 FBIB35: "Keep them"
 FBIT36: "A Gift Arrives"
 FBID36: "Our fellow Canton of [From.GetName], in the interest of Swiss unity and out of respect for our obviously preeminent state, has sent a special gift to us - the relics of an ancient Swiss saint thought lost for centuries.\nThe clerics of our largest basilica have already made space to install the relics, and surely they will attract swathes of pilgrims to boost the local economy - I mean nurture the spiritual health of our realm."
 FBIA36: "In per tuts!"
 FBIT37: "Opposition from Signoria"
 FBID37: "The current power of the Communia has understandably caused unrest and opposition amongst the more monarchist-minded citizens of the Commune. They are becoming more organized, and have now delivered an ultimatum to the [Root.Monarch.GetTitle]: more representation in administative bodies."
 FBIA37: "There is nothing we can do"
 FBIT38: "Opposition from Communia"
 FBID38: "The current power of the Signoria has understandably caused unrest and opposition amongst the more republican-minded citizens of the Commune. They are becoming more organized, and have now delivered an ultimatum to the [Root.Monarch.GetTitle]: more representation in administative bodies."
 FBIA38: "There is nothing we can do"
 FBIT39: "Communia e Signoria"
 FBID39: "The politics of Italian Communes were just as much locked between monarchists (Signoria) and republicans (Communia) as between Guelphs and Ghibellines. Despite the Ghibelline alignment with the Empire, there was little rhyme or reason to which faction matched which political philosophy. Most city-states were stuck in an endless cycle of republican revolutions and strongmen founding brief dynastic states.\n\nA festival this month has given us the opportunity to raise public support for our political agenda. How should we steer the Commune?"
 FBIA39: "Republicanism"
 FBIB39: "Monarchism"
 FBIT40: "A 'Free' Commune?"
 FBID40: "The power of rulers fluctuated greatly in medieval Italian Communes. Some [Root.Monarch.GetTitle]s attempted to wrestle control of their city's finances and mercantile enterprises from other powerful families in the interest of solidifying a hereditary lordship.\n\nAs certain elements of our constitution are being reexamined, should we attempt to bring more of [Root.GetName]'s merchant companies under our thumb?"
 FBIA40: "Free money"
 FBIB40: "It's in the name"
 FBIT41: "Conspiracy in the Commune"
 FBID41: "It has come to the attention of our [Root.Monarch.GetTitle] that one of our best generals is involved with a plot to overthrow the ruling family and install himself as leader. Such machinations were common in Italian city-states amongst the class of higher nobles and official 'protectors', and would often spell a long-term change in dynastic fortunes. Since we have discovered this plot, we can exile the general from our city, but we will obviously lose his talents if we do so."
 FBIA41: "Exile him"
 FBIB41: "We can hold out"
 FBIT42: "A Church Painter"
 FBID42: "One of the preeminent artists of our Commune has created a beautiful set of frescos and paintings for a local church. So beautiful, in fact, that it would embellish our administrative palace with its presence. The ruling family is quite enamored with the artist's work, but appropriating it from the church would certainly ruffle feathers around the Commune.\nIt was precisely this action for which Cicero famously prosecuted Gaius Verres in 70 BC. Do we dare challenge the legacy of that great Italian orator?"
 FBIA42: "Cicero is long dead"
 FBIB42: "It's sacrilege!"
 FBIT43: "Uncooperative Doukes"
 FBID43: "Byzantine rulers had to rely more on the cooperation of ad-hoc landowners ruling from manor houses than on something resembling an organized feudal system. It was almost as if the lands of the [Root.Monarch.GetTitle] were tributaries under [Root.Monarch.GetHerHim], though without any officially held titles. If the doux of a certain area was uncooperative, those tax revenues were simply lost, and the [Root.Monarch.GetTitle] would often have to militarily remind the doux of their obligations."
 FBIA43: "They'll pay next time"
 FBIT44: "A Loyal Bishop"
 FBID44: "Along the Empire's frontiers, local customs often abounded, and the [Root.Monarch.GetTitle]'s grasp was quite weak. Thankfully, our ecclesiastic hierarchy has been exemplary in certain areas, promoting the legitimacy of the government and the divine right of [Root.Monarch.GetName] [Root.Monarch.Dynasty.GetName]. Peasants are being drawn towards the ways and practices of the royal court."
 FBIA44: "Great!"
 FBIT45: "Famine Strikes Countryside"
 FBID45: "Since the Byzantine Empire was quite decentralized, famines could be particularly devestating to individual regions. In the old Roman Empire, the government attempted to assauge this issue by fixing bread prices and subsidizing bread rations to affected populations.\nIn the last harvest a famine has stricken one of our provinces, causing widespread unrest among the peasantry, and the local doux is unable to handle things. Should we attempt to use that ancient Roman solution?"
 FBIA45: "Bread and circus"
 FBIB45: "Let them starve"
 FBIC45: "Resettle them!"
 FBIT46: "An Ambitious General"
 FBID46: "In the Byzantine Empire, hereditary rule was sometimes weak and the whole concept of a 'dynasty' was muddied by adoptive members. Rather than sons succeeding fathers, powerful generals would force the ruling [Root.Monarch.GetTitle] to recognize them as an heir or just overthrow the government entirely at the head of their army.\nOur court spies have reported rumors that one of our top commanders is planning to do just that, citing the weakness of [Root.Monarch.GetTitle] [Root.Monarch.GetName]. Clearly we must not allow this to happen - it was the scheming general Phokas in 602 that slew the great Emperor Maurice and ruined the primacy of Christendom in the face of its heathen rivals!"
 FBIA46: "We must retire this general"
 FBIT47: "Doux Requests Privileges"
 FBID47: "Being the successors to the Roman villa system, we rely on the confidence and cooperation of a murky class of non-hereditary lords throughout the countrysides. One particular doux has approached the [Root.Monarch.GetTitle] requesting special rights and allowances, so that he may strenghten his family's hold in that particular region.\n\nTo grant his request would certainly anger the other powerful families in our state, but would ensure the loyalty of that area for the time being."
 FBIA47: "Grant them"
 FBIB47: "Send him away"
 FBIT48: "Melting Artifacts"
 FBID48: "It has come to our attention that some of [Root.Capital.GetCapitalName]'s many churches have hoarded vast stores of treasures that they do not need - gold candelabras, tabernacles, statues, silver plates, and similar artifacts. If we melt down these precious metals, it will greatly boost the royal coffers and minting programs, which have been sadly debased over the centuries from the glory days of the Solidus or Bezant."
 FBIA48: "We need the money"
 FBIB48: "Leave them be"
 FBIT49: "The Magna Carta"
 FBID49: "'[Root.Monarch.GetName], by the Grace of God [Root.Monarch.GetTitle] of [Root.GetName], &c, to his archbishops, bishops, abbots, earls, barons, justices, foresters, sheriffs, stewards, servants, and to all his officials and loyal subjects, Greeting.'\n\nThat is the preamble to what the united nobles of the realm are trying to force the [Root.Monarch.GetTitle] to declare, continuing on with rambling about their 'rights' and attempting to restrict royal prerogatives. They call this bill the Great Charter - Magna Carta - and promise their obedience if the court goes along with its issue. From now on, according to the charter, [Root.GetAdjective] [Root.Monarch.GetTitle]s will have to rule with the consent of a Parliament, comprised of the most important landowning vassals in the state.\n\nHow should we react to this strange dictum?"
 FBIA49: "We must sign it"
 FBIB49: "Crush the rabble!"
 FBIT50: "Rehabilitating Privateers"
 FBID50: "It's no secret that privateering, or indeed lawless piracy itself, is a far cry from the organized, disciplined ranks of an official state navy. There are, however, many parallels, and ships that excell in the legally ambiguous departments may also excell in warfare.\nThis is the idea behind a bill put forth by one of our top advisors to integrate a former privateering force into the navy. These man will require retraining, but it is believed that we can work with them."
 FBIA50: "We can live with this"
 FBIT51: "Spoils of Piracy"
 FBID51: "You can almost see the ship straining under the additional wait of its cargo - stolen goods and merchandise from our rivals abroad. Now we simply have to decide what to do with such riches - add them directly to the state's coffers, or reinvest them in these privateering programs?\n\nOf course, all that will happen after we let the crews take their fair share."
 FBIA51: "To the state"
 FBIB51: "Invest it"
 FBIT52: "Privateers Return Dividends"
 FBID52: "The continued success of our privateering operations have strengthened the overall power of our merchants in the region. While our neighbors' ships quake in fear of the black flag, our own men can sail around as they please, heightening their demand abroad. The government is already feeling the effects of this mercantile boost."
 FBIA52: "Wonderful"
 FBIT53: "A Pirate Fleet"
 FBID53: "Wars have taken their toll on our nation, and our navy is one of many institutions that has seen better days. We could, of course, attempt to use our privateering and pirate forces to succor this issue.\nWe must decide whether to keep these pirates as a reserve force, or have them immediately set out to take an active role, easing the pressure on our regular forces."
 FBIA53: "Send them out"
 FBIB53: "Keep them as reserves"
 FBIT54: "The Pirate Life"
 FBID54: "The life of a pirate is not all swashbuckling and adventures on the high seas. In many cases it involves enduring grueling conditions of weather and food supply, a sort of fortitude our employed troops would do well to learn from.\nThankfully our investment in privateering has rubbed off on the official navy, as many captains and crews alike have picked up tricks from their more unorthodox counterparts."
 FBIA54: "Great"
 FBIT55: "Piracy Policy"
 FBID55: "Our reliance on pirates has increased their power in the area, some would say too much. We are being urged by several top advisors to attempt to impose further regulations on piracy and more clearly delineate between pirate and privateer.\nOur scribes are preparing a new policy edict - how shall we address this issue?"
 FBIA55: "Let them roam free"
 FBIB55: "Crack down on it"
 FBIT56: "Going Legitimate"
 FBID56: "One of the most fearsome pirate lords of our age, scourge of the high seas, is in deals with our naval commanders to go legitimate. He wants to be employed by the state as a special consultant, and promises us great success if we assign him on high-stakes naval missions. Many scoff at his attempts, however, explaining that you can never make such a vile criminal bow to the sacred offices of the [Root.GetAdjective] navy.\nOnce a pirate, always a pirate."
 FBIA56: "Give him a chance"
 FBIB56: "Indeed"
 FBIT57: "Never Trust a Pirate"
 FBID57: "We authorized a certain privateer crew to attack and seize a great shipment of gold and silver reportedly being moved by one of our rival states. It has come to our attention now that the crew was successful in the endeavor, but driven mad by their lust for riches, have violated our lawful treaty and have made off with the money themselves, spending it haphazardly around the nation. We cannot let such an outrageous betrayal happen again!"
 FBIA57: "Curses!"
 FBIT58: "Unlicensed Shipbuilders"
 FBID58: "Obviously in keeping the high standards of [Root.GetName] alive in reputation, we impose strict licenses surrounding such matters as shipbuilding. It follows that a black market has developed in turn to fund the building and repair of less legally-inclined sailing ventures. Now that we have opened channels with so-called 'pirates' and given them a legal protection for their actions, we could also try to harness the power of these illicit shipwrights under the proper circumstances. Should we attempt to employ them to reinvigorate our trade fleet?"
 FBIA58: "Licenses for all"
 FBIB58: "We don't need them"
 FBIT59: "Lawsuit"
 FBID59: "An angry merchant who ran into trouble at the hands of our pirates has filed a suit against the state, alleging various oversights and misdeeds by the naval commisions in charge of managing privateers. The courts have been scandalized, and public opinion on the matter has been quite volatile. As the trial continues, the blame could very well fall on the [Root.Monarch.GetTitle] [Root.Monarch.GetHerselfHimself]."
 FBIA59: "Le tribunal c'est moi"
 FBIT60: "Heresy brewing in Occitania"
 FBID60: "Rumors have been circulated by travelers passing through remote mountain valleys in Southern France that agents of a vile heretical movement, the Bogomilists, have been sending missionaries to preach their poison amongst the French people. This news somehow made it to the Pope himself, who has urgently requested that we send a team of bishops to the area to see if the rumors hold any water and to condemn these travelling heresiarchs if they are found.\nHopefully they will return with word that the whole story is more nonsense from the gossip-monger peasants and we can get this whole matter behind us, like that business in Gévaudan with the supposed man-eating wolf."
 FBIA60: "We must investigate the allegations"
 fbia60.tt: "Our top prelates will appraise the extent of the heresy"
 FBIT61: "A Gift for the Pope"
 FBID61: "The most gracious Holy Father, King of Kings, vicar of Christ on Earth, was given all of Western Europe in fief by that great Emperor of Rome, Constantine. We should make a move to recognize the legitimacy of this donation by directly turning over some of our lands to the Papacy, to be integrated into their temporal domain. The city of Avignon seems like a good choice, as it has a fortified palace that the Popes could use as a residence when visiting France."
 FBIA61: "Donate Avignon!"
 FBIB61: "We can't afford it"
 FBIT62: "A Gift From [From.GetName]"
 FBID62: "The wise ruler of [From.GetName], recognizing our temporal rights over Europe, has seen fit to donate the city of Avignon to our holy patrimony. We must send an apostolic legate immediately to bring it in line with our administrative standards, and make preparations for a grand Pontifical entrance."
 FBIA62: "Deus Vult"
 FBIT63: "The Babylonian Captivity"
 FBID63: "As rightful rulers of France, we exert considerable influence over the Papacy due to their presence in Avignon. The local fortress has even been converted into another Papal estate - the Palais des Papes. We could tighten our stranglehold over Papal affairs if we simply strongarmed the Popes into compliance, confining them to Avignon and turning it into a new Vatican.\nThe global reaction from other Catholic states would be dire, but we could effectively turn the universal church into another branch of French governmental interests. With that kind of power, any opposition could be stamped out over time. Do we dare risk the reputational fallout of this bold gambit?"
 FBIA63: "Unlimited power!"
 FBIB63: "Execute whoever suggested it"
 FBIT64: "A Captive Papacy"
 FBID64: "It seems the 'magnanimous' gift of Avignon was simply a fraud of the scheming Frenchmen to increase their influence over our affairs! They have now forced [Root.Monarch.GetTitle] [Root.Monarch.GetName] to abandon the Vatican and move to Avignon, where [Root.Monarch.GetSheHe] is essentially under house arrest. The Holy, Universal, Catholic Church has been trodden under by the dogs, just as when the demonic Theophylacti of Tusculum used our supreme vicarate for their debaucheries during the Saeculum Obscurum. Hopefully our new French overlords will not sink to the level of the final Tusculan Pope, Benedictus IX, who became pope at age 20, served three separate terms, and was the only man to have sold the Papacy for a cash payout. \n\nO beware of false prophets, which come to you in sheep's clothing, but inwardly are ravening wolves!"
 FBIA64: "Woe!"
 FBIT65: "A Second Great Schism"
 FBID65: "Few thought something as devastating as the 1054 schism between the Western and Eastern churches could happen again, but that may just well occur due to our usurpation of Papal power. The latest Pope insists that he should return to Italy to govern the Church from its ancient seat, and will listen to none of our protests or threats.\nWe could simply call it a loss and let the Holy Father escape from our grasp, or we could challenge the legitimacy of his election in the first place, supplying our own candidate. This tactic was used extensively by the early Holy Roman Emperors in their own conflicts with the church, propping up so-called 'antipopes' with limited recognition. The virtuous and preeminent reputation of our state, of course, ensures many more Catholics will flock to our side if we denounce the current Pope as illegitimate."
 FBIA65: "We'll elect our own Pope"
 fbia65.tt: "We will establish a new Papacy at Avignon and demand the recognition of all Catholic monarchs"
 FBIB65: "If you love something, set it free"
 FBIT66: "Two Popes"
 FBID66: "By now word has spread far and wide that [From.GetName] has declared Pope [PAP.Monarch.GetName]'s election invalid and has put forth another candidate, Pope [AVI.Monarch.GetName], based out of Avignon. Only now have representatives of the competing Popes made it to our state and asked which side we stand with. What should we tell them?"
 FBIA66: "Avignon"
 FBIB66: "Rome"
 FBIT67: "Captivity Unrecognized"
 FBID67: "With the rise of popular theological movements across Europe, our continued claims over the Papacy are seen transparently by the citizenry of Europe, and no longer carry any clout. The Papacy has escaped from our grasp despite all our efforts."
 FBIA67: "Unfortunate"
 FBIT68: "Anabaptists take $PROVINCENAME$"
 FBID68: "When Martin Luther spread Protestantism across Europe, he brought with him a cavalcade of minor heresies and competing sects, each with views more bizarre than the last. One of such sects is the Anabaptists, who contend that baptism should be reserved for informed adults; those who were baptized as children should be re-baptized; and tout extremely radical ideas about property.\nWe would normally not concern ourselves with this rabble, but a heresiarch preacher in our capital has riled up these Anabaptists into a full-scale insurrection, taking over the administrative palaces and barricading the city walls. We must send in the army!"
 FBIA68: "Wipe them out"
 FBIT69: "Tempting Ideas"
 FBID69: "The Protestant Reformation has brought with it a host of strange and novel ideas about the Christian faith. One of the more esoteric views has come to be known as 'Anabaptism', referring to those who believe people should only be baptized as adults when they can make an informed, rational decision.\nWhen [Root.Monarch.GetTitle] [Root.Monarch.GetName] was travelling through [Root.Capital.GetCapitalName] Square recently, [Root.Monarch.GetSheHe] came across a mendicant preacher promoting the Anabaptist way of life. Before [Root.Monarch.GetHerHis] guards could beat the man down, [Root.Monarch.GetName] stopped them and continued to listen to his public sermon. It seems the preacher was quite tempting, as East Frisia is now considering a conversion to this strange new sect."
 FBIA69: "Convert"
 FBIB69: "Stick to our faith"
 FBIT70: "Treaty of Venice"
 FBID70: "The status of the Papacy within the Holy Roman Empire has always been dubious, as the donations of Pepin and Constantine and the nominal role of Rome as the Empire's capital muddy the waters regarding what degree of freedom we should have. With the Investiture Controversy in mind, and the rise of Guelph-Ghibelline strife across the Italian peninsula, perhaps it is time to seek de-jure independence from the conglomeration calling itself Holy and Roman."
 FBIA70: "Declare Independence"
 FBIB70: "Tie our fate to the Empire"
 flavor_kni.EVTNAME6: "A New Home for the Knights"
 flavor_kni.EVTDESC6: "With Rhodes in the hands of the true faith, the Pope has suggested we establish the island as a new home for the Knights Hospitaller, who can use it as a bastion against heretics and heathens alike. His Holiness would be greatly pleased with us if we agreed to the deal."
 flavor_kni.EVTOPTA6: "Of course we will support this"
 flavor_kni.EVTOPTB6: "Give up land? Never!"
 flavor_sco.EVTNAME11: "Robert the Bruce"
 flavor_sco.EVTDESC11: "The political situation in Scotland is ever-evolving. The de-facto ruler of the Scottish realm under the temporary ruling council, John Comyn, has been assaulted by another powerful noble named Robert de Brus and his henchmen. If Robert is able to carry out this foul murder, he will likely be affirmed as the new King. Robert has a history of machiavellian cooperation with the English, but many nobles believe he is our best hope in strengthening the state internally."
 flavor_sco.EVTOPTA11: "Wake up, time to die."
 flavor_sco.EVTOPTB11: "Guards!"
 flavor_sco.EVTNAME12: "William Wallace"
 flavor_sco.EVTDESC12: "A young knight from the Scottish nobility has distinguished himself as a leader. We have recruited him into our continual effort to shirk off foreign invaders, may he lead the Scots to victory!"
 flavor_sco.EVTOPTA12: "You make take our lives..."
 aow_events.377.t: "The Cause of the Anabaptist Plague"
 aow_events.377.d: "Normally, each nation's rabble is their own concern. Not so when another nation openly espouses the same spiritual rot as the rabble. Many among both the clergy and military draw a straight line between the Anabaptist revolters we fight today and the dedication to the Anabaptist cause shown by our neighbors. We cannot remain a respected and feared nation in the eyes of others if we do not confront them about their support, explicit or implicit, of the heretics who assault the [Root.GetAdjective] lands."
 aow_events.377.a: "They better have an answer for us!"
 aow_events.377.b: "Let us not stir up more trouble over this."
