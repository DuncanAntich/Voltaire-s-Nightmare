 pir_i1: "More Guidelines Than Rules"
 pir_i1_desc: "Privateers are great innovators when it comes to ship combat. By adopting their knowledge and tactics in our regular fleet, we will become more effective."
 pir_i2: "Just Good Business"
 pir_i2_desc: "Trade is a major part of international relations. If we apply the right kind of pressure, we might be able to influence nations to our point of view."
 pir_i3: "Stop Blowing Holes in My Ship"
 pir_i3_desc: "Ordinarily, damaged enemy ships are abandoned, but many are still servicable. We could easily repair them and use them to grow our own fleets."
 pir_i4: "Pieces of Eight"
 pir_i4_desc: "The more loot our privateers gain, the less we have to pay them, and the more money we make."
 pir_i5: "The Triple Guns"
 pir_i5_desc: "Privateer ships are involved in more skirmishes than most. It would be in our interests and theirs to arm them more heavily in the future."
 pir_i6: "Why is the Rum Gone?"
 pir_i6_desc: "Privateers have plenty of techniques for running a blockade. We could use their expertise to enhance our own blockades, and prevent supplies and reinforcements from reaching the enemy."
 pir_i7: "Letters of Marque"
 pir_i7_desc: "Pirates tend to make the best privateers. By offering them official pardons in exchange for employment, we could greatly increase the effectiveness of our privateers."
 cul_i1: "Assimilation"
 cul_i1_desc: "Some may call it ethnic cleansing, some may call it an authoritarian strongarm of native peoples into accepting our language and customs. We prefer to see it as conquered populations appropriating our culture."
 cul_i2: "Public Relations Department"
 cul_i2_desc: "When the reputation of our state is smeared, we need diplomats to do damage control. In the past, this was a nebulous and disorganized endeavor - but today we may establish an official mouthpiece of the state, a voice with which to correct misconceptions about us."
 cul_i3: "National Pride"
 cul_i3_desc: "Parades, local customs to celebrate past victories, distinct cuisines and styles of clothing - we should distinguish ourselves from our neighbors by fostering a fierce national pride based on those idiosyncracies which are distinctly ours."
 cul_i4: "Multiculturalism"
 cul_i4_desc: "It might seem contradictory to the notion of 'national pride' that we embrace multiculturalism, but we can maintain a culture of our own while still accepting the practices of others. "
 cul_i5: "Export our Values"
 cul_i5_desc: "Tolerance of other cultures should be exported across Europe and the Maghreb! Developing our naval transportation methods and shipbuilding will allow us to ferry men around the world on a much larger scale, bringing the glory of the realm to those backwards enough not to have heard of it."
 cul_i6: "Heritage"
 cul_i6_desc: "The roots of the state are ancient. Some scholars claim our tongue was spoken in Eden itself, the first of all languages in the world. Whether or not that's true, the government has a strong tradition reinforcing its legitimacy."
 cul_i7: "Eius Religio"
 cul_i7_desc: "'His Religion', yes, the religion of your neighbor - surely the same religion as yours! Poor is the land where the belief system of its population isn't tied to their cultural identity."
 log_i1: "Crusades"
 log_i1_desc: "What if church, state, and military can merge together at some common point? Take up arms, rich and poor, and defend the true faith from the unrelenting slings and arrows of heathenry."
 log_i2: "Echelons"
 log_i2_desc: "Outflanking the enemy can be essential to victory. More important however, is not getting outflanked ourselves. Splitting our cavalry units into smaller, more maneuverable divisions means we can more easily reinforce weak spots and react quicker to enemy attempts to flank."
 log_i3: "Positive Reinforcement"
 log_i3_desc: "'It's not about how hard you hit. It's about how hard you can get hit and keep moving forward.' - Rocco di Balboa"
 log_i4: "Selective Breeding"
 log_i4_desc: "Cavalry is essential to a well developed army. Through breeding our own war horses, we can cut costs."
 log_i5: "Training Drills"
 log_i5_desc: "Regular training keeps the army fit and prepared for any eventuality."
 log_i6: "Navigation Tools"
 log_i6_desc: "Through the use of the astrolabe and the compass, our Captains have developed unparalleled navigation skills that ensure swift passage to any destination."
 log_i7: "Terrain Mastery"
 log_i7_desc: "Through extensive training and years of experience, our generals have learned how to use the terrain to their advantage. They are able to use their knowledge to move armies through unknown territory faster and attack into unfavorable positions without a disadvantage."
 man_i1: "Co-Operative Fabrication"
 man_i1_desc: "If we can get the monasteries and other artisanal classes to work in tandem with the peasantry, we can cut much of the waste out of our production process."
 man_i2: "Build Windmills"
 man_i2_desc: "Ancient prototypes exist for a device which harnesses the power of winds to turn a grinding stone. New technological breakthroughs allow us to make this a reality, and greatly boost our production of foods and materials."
 man_i3: "The Art of Dodging"
 man_i3_desc: "Improving the processes of ore purification and then alloying will allow for us to supply better armor to the troops, and at lower costs. Why train for dodging when you can take a sword to the helm and survive?"
 man_i4: "Trade Infrastructure"
 man_i4_desc: "It would be beneficial to not only construct production facilities themselves, but buildings that can bolster our trade power - inns, customs houses, or banks, for example."
 man_i5: "Reinvestment"
 man_i5_desc: "All citizens know the taxes and tithes they pay eventually go back to their protection, benefit, and salvation. Of course, we could make the process more transparent by reinvesting our profit off individual cities directly back into them, rather than collecting the revenue in the state treasury for more general purposes."
 man_i6: "Trade Privileges"
 man_i6_desc: "By dictating special priveleges to domestic traders and regulations for foreigners, we can get a stranglehold over all mercantile power in our lands. Exchange rates? Weak currencies inviting investments? We don't have to worry about that for centuries!"
 man_i7: "Standardized Blueprints"
 man_i7_desc: "Architecture on an ad-hoc basis is how we have operated since time immemorial, but now we should make an effort to use standardized plans for buildings and farms. It will be much less of a headache all around to construct fresh structures across the realm, allowing us to build at a fraction of the usual time."

 exploration_ideas_bonus: "Full Colonial Focus"
 kammergericht_desc: "In order to regularize control of the Margraviate of Brandenburg the early rulers would replace local common law with Roman law. They would further regulate justice by moving the Supreme Court from the court of the Elector (who was prone to moving around) to fixed and central location. This simultaneously improved justice and curbed the power of local magnates."
 amsterdam_wisselbank: "Found the Wisselbank"
 amsterdam_wisselbank_desc: "The problem with metal coinage was that it was virtually impossible to make coins of equal weight at all mints. This makes moving wealth around, the life blood of trade, difficult. The Wisselbank traded metal money for Amsterdam paper money that had to be used in the city for bills over 600 guilders. This created a medium of exchange that everyone could be confident in the value of, facilitating exchange."
 imperial_ambitions_desc: "The fall of the Carolingians led to chaos in the Empire and Salic administration has legalized anarchy by calling a constitution. However the Imperial title deserves to be held by our most noble house from its power base in Austria. We must achieve this title and then seek to reform the Empire to make it Holy, Roman, and an Empire once more."
 habsburg_dominance: "Diplomatic Dominance"
 additional_colonists: "Claim Forgery"
 additional_colonists_desc: "The first step in fabricating claims is forging historical documents, ancient affidavits promising some land or other. By understanding philological disciplines, we can create more convincing frauds which even the most skeptical scholars will believe."
 quest_for_the_new_world_desc: "The new world is many things, most important of all, empty. Well no one important lives there at any rate. By letting people know of the boundless opportunities we have in the new world we will encourage more people to go forth and settle there."
 cat_fortifying_catalonia_desc: "Catalonia has many potential threats and enemies. The coasts have often come under attack by Barbary pirates and across the Pyrenees invasions have often been staged into the core of the Catalan region. We must do what we can to fortify our country to ensure the safety of our young state and to make the most of the local geography."
#Amalfi
 AML_ideas: "Amalfitan Ideas"
 AML_ideas_start: "Amalfitan Traditions"
 AML_ideas_bonus: "Amalfitan Ambitions"
 AML_idea_1: "Emerging maritime republic"
 AML_idea_1_desc: "In the 10th and 11th centuries Amalfi was an influential maritime republic, often compared to the trading states of Genoa, Venice and Pisa. Even though we were the first of these nations to be surpassed and perished, we can use our potential and expand our influence in the Mediterranean."
 AML_idea_2: "Founded by Heracles"
 AML_idea_2_desc: "A legend tells that the name of the city comes from Amalfi, a nymph who was in love with Heracles and whose name was Amalfi. She died very young and Heracles buried her here, in the most beautiful place for him, and founded a town with her name."
 AML_idea_3: "Richest and most glamorous city in the Lombard Kingdom"
 AML_idea_3_desc: "During its heyday in the 10th century, Amalfi was praised by Arab travellers as the "richest and most glamorous city" in the Lombard Kingdom. Our republic, which also included neighbouring towns, had more than 50,000 inhabitants at that time."
 AML_idea_4: "Sant'Andrea"
 AML_idea_4_desc: "The three-nave cathedral of Amalfi was built in the 10th century and repeatedly rebuilt and extended in the following centuries. In the crypt are kept the bones of the apostle Andrew, the patron saint of Amalfi."
 AML_idea_5: "Monti Lattari"
 AML_idea_5_desc: "Amalfi lies on the Lattari Mountains, a mountain range up to 1444 metres high, which the Romans used as a refuge from the Germanics and Longobards. They serve as a natural defence, deterring potential enemies."
 AML_idea_6: "Tabula Amalphitana"
 AML_idea_6_desc: "Amalfi developed Italy's first maritime codification, the Tabula Amalphitana, which was still valid far beyond the lifetime of the maritime republic in the whole Mediterranean area."
 AML_idea_7: "Inventor of the compass"
 AML_idea_7_desc: "The navigator Flavio Gionia is said to be the inventor of the compass in whose honour a monument was built in Amalfi. Even if its existence cannot be proven, the compass helps our sailors and traders to find their way on the open sea."
#Malta
 JAI_ideas: "Maltese Ideas"
 JAI_ideas_start: "Maltese Traditions"
 JAI_ideas_bonus: "Maltese Ambitions"
 JAI_idea_1: "Saint Paul's Respite"
 JAI_idea_1_desc: "The biblical Acts of the Apostles tells a story in which Saint Paul was shipwrecked on an island called Melite. Some have remained skeptical as to whether this island was the same as Malta, but we Maltese know for sure that this is the truth!"
 JAI_idea_2: "Tas-Silg"
 JAI_idea_2_desc: "Tas-Silg is the name of a hill which commands Marsaxlokk Bay on the southern coast of Malta. It was the site of a Byzantine monastery which became heavily fortified in the eighth century due to the thread of Muslim raids."
 JAI_idea_3: "Arabic Influences"
 JAI_idea_3_desc: "The Maltese language is a curious one. About half its vocabulary is Italian, but another third is made up of Arabic, as is the grammatical structure. Though it is scarcely mutually intelligible with Maghrebi Arabic, the Islamic presence on the island is unforgettable and lives on to the present."
 JAI_idea_4: "Great Siege of Malta"
 JAI_idea_4_desc: "The 1565 siege of Malta by the Ottoman Empire is perhaps the most famous siege of the Early Modern west. 40,000 Ottoman troops under the pirate Dragut surrounded the island and spent three months trying to take its fortress, defended by the Knights Hospitaller's 6,000 men. The Knights' general Jean de Valette managed to withstand the siege against all odds, destroying the image of Ottoman invincibility and later getting the capital city named after himself. Voltaire once claimed 'nothing is better known than the siege of Malta.'"
 JAI_idea_5: "Noria"
 JAI_idea_5_desc: "The relatively brief period of Islamic rule in Malta produced a profound effect on the local agriculture, as irrigation infrastructure like waterwheels (noria) were created and new crops such as cotton, oranges, and lemons were planted."
 JAI_idea_6: "Ir-Rewwixta tal-Qassisin"
 JAI_idea_6_desc: "The 'Rising of the Priests' was an incident in 1775 when the clergy of Malta rose up against the decadent and declining Knights Hospitaller and took over two of the island's important forts, Fort Saint Elmo and Saint James Cavalier. Though it was put down, it proved the populace would not stand for tyranny and poverty."
 JAI_idea_7: "The Maltese Falcon"
 JAI_idea_7_desc: "Legend holds that in the 1500s, as a reward for the continued support of the King of Spain, the Knights Hospitaller created a solid-gold statue of a falcon encrusted with jewels. This artifact is priceless and is the object of many adventurers' journies. We must tear apart every vault of Malta to find it!"
#Armagnac
 AMG_ideas: "Armagnac Ideas"
 AMG_ideas_start: "Armagnac Traditions"
 AMG_ideas_bonus: "Armagnac Ambition"
 AMG_political_manoeuvres: "Political Manoeuvres"
 AMG_political_manoeuvres_desc: "Armagnac has long been a nation known for its potential to be unpredictable in its diplomacy. Several times the counts of Armagnac outright defied the authority of the French king, including partaking in large scale rebellions against the house of Valois. These actions have earned us quite the reputation on the diplomatic scene."
 AMG_scattered_territories: "Scattered Territories"
 AMG_scattered_territories_desc: "Through marriage and purchase of land, the counts of Armagnac were able to expand a once unimportant fief on the borderlands of Gascony to several far-flung counties which stretched from Rodez to Nemours. The task of managing these lands has been a difficult one at times, but with the right administrative policies we can ensure they remain indivisible from our home territory."
 AMG_shifting_alliances: "Shifting Alliances"
 AMG_shifting_alliances_desc: "Throughout the Late Middle Ages Armagnac kept its precarious position as an independent fief through its clever use of alliances to suit its interests. Even now, these diplomatic strategies will only become more important to ensure the survival of our nation in the future."
 AMG_armagnac_faction: "The Armagnac Faction"
 AMG_armagnac_faction_desc: "During the time of the Hundred Years' War, the politics within France were dominated by two opposing factions, the Armagnacs and the Burgundians. This rivalry was exacerbated by events such as the assassination of the Armagnac-supporting Duke of Orleans in 1407. Tensions came to a head when the Duchy of Burgundy allied itself with the English, resulting in a bloody civil war. However during these times, the mercenary forces of the Armagnacs in particular showed their prowess on the field, and their tactics still remain with us today."
 AMG_armagnac_brandy: "Brandy of Armagnac"
 AMG_armagnac_brandy_desc: "Our distilled wine is some of the earliest and most famous to be cultivated in France, and is traded extensively in the region surrounding Auch. Additionally, Dutch merchants have begun to take an interest in the commodity. Let us seize the opportunity to accumulate great wealth from this trade."
 AMG_powerful_dynasty: "Powerful Dynasty"
 AMG_powerful_dynasty_desc: "Only a few centuries ago was the county of Armagnac at the peak of its power, and being regarded as one of the most powerful entities in Aquitaine. While this glory has largely dissipated since then, we can still be credited as an influential dynasty within the borders of France itself."
 AMG_archbishops_of_aquitaine: "Archbishops of Aquitaine"
 AMG_archbishops_of_aquitaine_desc: "The capital of the region of Armagnac, Auch, is the seat of the Archdiocese of Auch. It came into existence as early as the 6th century and claimed the prestigious title of archbishops of Aquitaine and Navarre."
#Foix
 FOI_ideas: "Foixian Ideas"
 FOI_ideas_start: "Foixian Traditions"
 FOI_ideas_bonus: "Foixian Ambition"
 FOI_neighbour_connections: "Neighbour Connections"
 FOI_neighbour_connections_desc: "The neighbouring lands outside of France, such as that of the kingdom of Navarre, have done much to benefit our overall standing. With constant diplomatic interactions with them, we will always be able to count on their support should we need it."
 FOI_vassals_in_name: "Vassals Only in Name"
 FOI_vassals_in_name_desc: "Unlike the other appanages of France, who have seen themselves aggressively integrated into the 'domaine royal', we have managed to hold onto our virtual independence in all but name for centuries. This has given us the advantage of being able to expand our army without suspicions of the king."
 FOI_provincial_lords: "Provincial Lords"
 FOI_provincial_lords_desc: "The county of Foix is divided into several small holdings, each governed by lords who had a say in the government, despite their vassal status. Upholding these traditions will make our nation much easier to govern."
 FOI_chateau_foix: "Chateau de Foix"
 FOI_chateau_foix_desc: "The Chateau de Foix lies on the foothills of the Pyrenees, and serves as a point of defence against any enemies seeking to conquer us. However in past years the castle has become somewhat neglected; it is time we realise its importance and upgrade its defences to better withstand a siege."
 FOI_dynastic_expansion: "Dynastic Expansion"
 FOI_dynastic_expansion_desc: "The county of Foix on its own is not a significant land to hold by any means, but thanks to the ambitious nature and skill of our previous rulers we have managed to enlarge our domains to encompass the viscounties of Bearn and Bigorre. Now that the titles of Bearn and Foix have been ruled together for so long, they have become practically synonymous with each other. Those who may otherwise believe our claims to these lands are false will be much less likely to question our legitimacy to them."
 FOI_mediators_of_war: "Mediators of War"
 FOI_mediators_of_war_desc: "Foix has seen itself embroiled in many a conflict across the ages, owing to its position on the border between two distinct cultures. Many counts of Foix fought in battles miles from their own land, as well as with local neighbours such as the Armagnacs. This has given us a unique role to play in the region as those who will not hesitate to intervene should tensions spill over."
 FOI_navarrese_influence: "Navarrese Influence"
 FOI_navarrese_influence_desc: "Foix and Bearn share much of its history with the kingdom of Navarre, as the counts of Foix were able to successfully install their descendants on the Navarrese throne. In fact parts of Bearn lie within the Basque area, which enabled cities such as Pau to prosper from becoming the seat of government of the united Navarre and Foix."
#Auvergne
 AUV_ideas: "Auvergnese Ideas"
 AUV_ideas_start: "Auvergnese Traditions"
 AUV_ideas_bonus: "Auvergnese Ambition"
 AUV_massif_central: "The Massif Central"
 AUV_massif_central_desc: "The Massif Central is an elevated region which covers much of the south of France. In Auvergne however the peaks are at their highest, making it extremely difficult for an enemy to traverse it."
 AUV_heart_of_southern_france: "The Heart of Southern France"
 AUV_heart_of_southern_france_desc: "Despite Auvergne's vast hills, agriculture dominates the economy of the region and we are renowned for our farming practices. Being barely affected by the Hundred Years' War has allowed us to harbour a flourishing economy, whereas other regions of France may not be quite the same after the ravages of English occupation."
 AUV_reform_succession_law: "Reform Succession Law"
 AUV_reform_succession_law_desc: "The territory of Auvergne historically had three components: the County, the Duchy and the Dauphinate. This has made our legitimacy prone to being questioned, as other royal houses could intermarry with our dependents and inherit any of the three titles. If we want to guarantee our independence, we must reform our succession law and rid ourselves of any foreign influence."
 AUV_auvergnat_identity: "Auvergnese Identity"
 AUV_auvergnat_identity_desc: "While many might think of us as equals with that of the Occitan people, we in fact are much different. Auvergnat is a major dialect of the Occitan language which is spoken widely by our people; this is the fact which allows us to reinforce our claims to national sovereignty."
 AUV_blood_of_arverni: "Blood of the Arverni"
 AUV_blood_of_arverni_desc: "The land of Auvergne was once inhabited by the Arverni, a Gallic tribe which eventually fell under control of the Roman Empire, as did the rest of Gaul. However, a great chieftain named Vercingetorix led a grand resistance against the occupation. Though the Arverni were eventually subjugated again, the bravery and blood of our ancestors still flow through us."
 AUV_frankish_roots: "Frankish Roots"
 AUV_frankish_roots_desc:  "Auvergne was one of the earliest states within the borders of France to have come to existence, and since the time of the Carolingians a long line of counts and dukes have ruled the land in succession. This is a feat which very few states like us have managed to accomplish."
 AUV_end_clermont_rivalry: "End the Clermont Rivalry"
 AUV_end_clermont_rivalry_desc: "Ever since the Middle Ages there has been enmity between the counts of Auvergne and the bishops around the area of Clermont. In order to place limits on the clergy's power in the area the counts founded the city of Montferrand, however this has only served to further intensify the problems of centuries ago. In order to end the rivalry once and for all we should merge the two cities. This would increase Clermont's economic output greatly while also benefitting the clergy."
#Bourbon
 BOU_ideas: "Bourbon Ideas"
 BOU_ideas_start: "Bourbon Traditions"
 BOU_ideas_bonus: "Bourbon Ambition"
 BOU_castle_montlucon: "Castle of Montluçon"
 BOU_castle_montlucon_desc: "Montluçon Castle dates back to 1070, when it was a small outpost first built by the seigneur of Bourbon. Over the centuries it gradually transformed into a major castle, its development spurred on by the Hundred Years' War. Now it is a sign of our wealth and power and will significantly hamper any invasion of our lands."
 BOU_loyal_nation: "A Loyal Nation"
 BOU_loyal_nation_desc: "Traditionally the house of Bourbon was loyal to the kings of France, and often lent their forces to the royal domain in times of need. This has been beneficial to us in many ways, since the kings granted Bourbon many privileges in exchange for their help. The most major of which was the elevation of our territory to the status of a duchy in 1327, greatly increasing our prestige and prosperity."
 BOU_bordering_cultures: "Bordering Cultures"
 BOU_bordering_cultures_desc: "The province of Bourbon sits at the crossroads between the distinct Langue d'oil and the Lenga d'oc. While we have generally favoured the influence of the northern dialects in the past, our heritage is closely linked with that of Occitania. Let us cherish this relationship by making our land as much renowned for the Occitan people as the French."
 BOU_natural_borders: "Natural Borders"
 BOU_natural_borders_desc: "From the towering hills of the Massif Central in the south to the Loire flowing in the east, our geographical position is well-placed in the centre of France to guard much of our borders from attack. While foreign enemies may be faced with a completely unknown territory, our armies have extensive knowledge of the terrain and thus can defend themselves better during combat."
 BOU_dynastic_claims: "Dynastic Claims"
 BOU_dynastic_claims_desc: "Because of the prominence that Bourbon dukes achieved in the French court, they were given various territories as appanages, assisting in the expansion of Bourbon power. While the ownership of these counties changed as dynasties fell and others rose, we still have sufficient grounds to grow a power base outside of our heartland by seizing advantage of our claims to them."
 BOU_cadet_houses_of_bourbon: "Cadet Houses of Bourbon"
 BOU_cadet_houses_of_bourbon_desc: "Due to the complex nature of feudal politics, the house of Bourbon is also subdivided into several cadet branches, such as the lines of Bourbon-Montpensier and Condé. Some of these noble families are powerful and have a major influence in French affairs."
 BOU_bourbon_kings: "Bourbon Kings"
 BOU_bourbon_kings_desc: "Historically the house of Bourbon was one of the largest and most prestigious houses in early modern Europe, providing the kings for France and Spain by the 18th century. However, it cannot be forgotten that the house has its origins in Bourbonnais itself, and our name is widely known among ruling classes as a result of this."
#Albret
 ABR_ideas: "Albretienne Ideas"
 ABR_ideas_start: "Albretienne Traditions"
 ABR_ideas_bonus: "Albretienne Ambition"
 ABR_longbow_tactics: "Longbow Tactics"
 ABR_longbow_tactics_desc: "Our brief co-operation with the English during the Hundred Years' War has enabled us to inherit the ways of their skilled longbowmen. By adopting their tactics and putting them into practice we will be able to create a significantly better army."
 ABR_found_trading_ports: "Found Trading Ports"
 ABR_found_trading_ports_desc: "Albret is one of the only fiefdoms of France to have access to the sea, however the lack of any ports to relay trade has become a problem. To remedy this we should found a main port on what coastline we have, so that our nation can exchange commerce across the Cote d'Argent."
 ABR_mad_war: "The Mad War"
 ABR_mad_war_desc: "The Mad War was one of the defining points of our history, when in 1485 the lord of Albret, Alain 'the Great', attempted to take control of the duchy of Brittany through marriage. The resulting war was a valiant rebellion against the French monarchy, however it was quickly put down and the duchess of Brittany married the king of France instead. While the war was a defeat, we can learn from our shortcomings and build a more resilient army."
 ABR_gascon_connections: "Gascon Connections"
 ABR_gascon_connections_desc: "Albret shares its history with the collection of states that once made up the region of Gascony, and we are one of the few states that still survive even after the region was heavily contested between the English and the French for centuries. With our close proximity to major cities such as Bordeaux we can establish strong connections with them to benefit our economy."
 ABR_the_last_fiefdom: "The Last Fiefdom"
 ABR_the_last_fiefdom_desc: "The appanages under the control of the house of Albret continued to remain subordinate, but not fully integrated, into the royal demesne until 1572. At this time the house had expanded significantly and had major land holdings in the south of France, including the kingdom of Navarre."
 ABR_shipyard_of_albret: "Shipyard of Albret"
 ABR_shipyard_of_albret_desc: "A navy is one of the centrepieces of trade, and with our focus towards establishing trade links by sea the importance of having a navy is greater than ever before. Let us construct a grand shipyard for the construction of ships to facilitate our trade."
 ABR_landes_forest: "Landes Forest"
 ABR_landes_forest_desc: "The forests which once dominated the landscape around Albret have now been all but depleted due to deforestation. However, if we were to usher in new development projects to create a new pine plantation, our economy and industry would considerably improve."
#Etruria
 ETR_ideas: "Etrurian Ideas"
 ETR_ideas_start: "Etrurian Traditions"
 ETR_ideas_bonus: "Etrurian Ambitions"
 ETR_idea_1: "Ancient Namesake"
 ETR_idea_1_desc: "Etruria takes its name from the ancient region of Etruria, inhabited in pre-Roman times by the Etruscan civilization. The Etruscans were rivals to Rome and stood as the dominant force in central Italy for centuries after Rome's foundation in 753 BC."
 ETR_idea_2: "Napoleonic Client"
 ETR_idea_2_desc: "Etruria was founded specifically by Napoléon Bonaparte as a client state of the French Empire. Our fate is tied to that of Revolutionary France and its invincible armies!"
 ETR_idea_3: "The Bourbon Dynasty"
 ETR_idea_3_desc: "Louis I de Bourbon was a duke of Parma when it was annexed by France and he was subsequently given rule over Etruria as compensation. He hailed from the famed Bourbon dynasty, kings of Spain and former kings of France as cadets of the original Capetians."
 ETR_idea_4: "Queen Maria Luisa"
 ETR_idea_4_desc: "Daughter of the King of Spain, Maria Luisa was the consort of the first Etrurian monarch Louis I and after his premature death in 1803 she exercised power in the kingdom on behalf of her infant son Charles. She reformed taxation and manufacturing, swelled the ranks of the army, and funded educational enterprises like the School of Science and Museum of Physics."
 ETR_idea_5: "Florence"
 ETR_idea_5_desc: "The capital of the Kingdom of Etruria was, of course, Florence, which surpassed even other famed Tuscan cities like Pisa and Siena. Florence was a cultural powerhouse and Queen Maria was famed as an entertainer of the Florentine people, holding lavish parties for artists and scholars in the royal palace."
 ETR_idea_6: "Spy and Smuggler Haven"

 ANC_idea_1_desc: "Ancona was part of five central urban centers in the Byzantine Duchy of the Pentapolis, within the larger Exarchate of Ravenna. This duchy lasted until 752 AD when we again became a central administrative center of the Frankish march of Ancona."
 ANC_idea_2: "Stamira"
 ANC_idea_2_desc: "The siege of 1173 was the most dramatic in Ancona's history. Surrender was almost guaranteed as a large Venetian fleet blockaded the port and an Imperial army under Christian of Mainz besieged the walls. However, a patriotic woman named Stamira sallied from the walls and sacrificed herself by lighting pitch on fire to rout the attackers."
 ANC_idea_3: "Adriatic Renaissance"
 ANC_idea_3_desc: "The Adriatic Sea saw close connections forged between major cities like Ancona, Venice, Zara, Ragusa, and Rimini. A rediscovery of classical art, fused with the existing Gothic style, characterized the so-called 'Adriatic Renaissance' which spread between these cities in the fourteenth and fifteenth centuries."
 ANC_idea_4: "Republicanism"
 ANC_idea_4_desc: "Unlike most of the cities under nominal Papal sovereignty, Ancona never developed into a hereditary seignory ruled by a strongman. Only a brief conquest by the Malatesta from 1348-1383 marred its record."
 ANC_idea_5: "Ciriaco de' Pizzicolli"
 ANC_idea_5_desc: "In 1391 Ancona was the birthplace of the famous Italian antiquarian Ciriaco de' Pizzicolli, dubbed the father of archaeology.

 ANC_idea_6: "Jewish Rights"
 ANC_idea_6_desc: "In 1569 the Papacy banned the Jews from its lands with the exception of three cities - Rome itself, Avignon, and Ancona, where they could live in ghettos. Prior to attempted Papal persecutions in 1555, the Jewish community in Ancona numbered at 2,700."
 ANC_idea_7: "Confraternita dei Greci"
 ANC_idea_7_desc: "Due to our close historical ties with Byzantium, including sworn allegiance to the Komnenid Emperors, Ancona was also home to a singificant Greek Orthodox minority.

 LSX_idea_6: "Microstatehood"
 LSX_idea_6_desc: "Napoléon Bonaparte was the greatest architect of mediatisation in European history, bringing about the end of literally thousands of stately titles which had existed since time immemorial. By escaping the sphere of influence of Bavaria, Liechtenstein became the only microstate of the Holy Roman Empire to survive the eventual unification."
 LSX_idea_7: "Constitution of 1862"

 ARP_idea_2_desc: "Our nation is centered around the river Rhône, one of the most significant rivers of Europe. As a navigable river, the Rhône is crucial in connecting the Mediterranean with the major cities of Arpitania - Arles, Avignon, Valence, Vienne, Lyon, and Genève. One can sail all the way to Lake Geneva at breakneck speeds."
 ARP_idea_3: "Arles Amphitheatre"
 ARP_idea_3_desc: "In 90 AD the Romans built an impressive ampitheatre at Arles which could seat up to 20,000 people. When the empire fell, the clever Arelat citizens converted the ampitheatre into a fortress complete with houses and four watchtowers. The theatre was, in effect, a tiny walled city."
 ARP_idea_4: "We Were Carolingians"
 ARP_idea_4_desc: "The roots of the Kingdom of Arles lay in the gavelkind successions of the Carolingian Franks. The Treaty of Prüm in 855 gave Arles to Charles of Provence, and in 879 Boso of Provence founded another kingdom in the region. These great Frankish kings are our ancestors!"

The abbey, not even supported by the bishops of Mâcon and Lyon, sought support elsewhere and the counts of Beaujeu gave them their support and protection. And so they became military allies."
 BEA_idea_2: "Le Vignoble du Beaujolais"
 BEA_idea_2_desc: "The wine of Beujolais is a world-renowned wine produced in the region named after the County of Beujeu. Primarily red wines are produced here. The soil of the region is mostly granitoid sand. The wine has a refined, very aromatic taste. There is an old and strong connection between the cuisine of Lyon and the Beaujolais, that had historically been exported a lot to the Lyon region, as the very fruited taste of the wine combines well with the local charcuterie."
 BEA_idea_3: "La Guerre entre Lyon et Beaujeu"
 BEA_idea_3_desc: "The Counts of Beajeux once performed a war in 1289 against the Bishops of Lyon, which they had easily won, and left the Archbishopric in a bad shape. It also strengthened their power over the neighbor, ensuring that some forced peace could exist between the two, and that certain laws, important for the County, could also be enforced in Lyon. "
 BEA_idea_4: "Édouard I de Beaujeu"

 BEA_idea_6: "La Bête du Lyonnais"
 BEA_idea_6_desc: "The beast of Lyon was an anthropophagic animal that committed a series of attacks against humans, usually children under 15 years old. The corpses were generally half-devoured. The first attack had been recorded in the summer of 1754, somewhere in the County of Beaujolais, suggesting that the animal came from here. The following attacks were usually located closer to Lyon. The animal, or animals, had made about 30 victims (and an unknown number of wounded) till the end of 1756.\n\n The beast was usually described as a wolf, with less taller legs, a rougher fur and a multi-colored skin. Some thought it was a hyena, but the species hadn’t been defined back then, and some thought this could’ve been a werewolf."
 BEA_idea_7: "Sell the Right to Hunt"
 BEA_idea_7_desc: "The Counts of Beaujeu, ruling over a well-forested area, sold the right to hunt to their inhabitants, and not only to the bourgeoisie, which greatly increased their income, as the farmers were eager to gain more meat and kill the animals who destroyed their vines, crops or cattle. And if more got produced, then more tax income could be created, so it was deemed to be a win-win situation."

Pope Gregory the Great gave the crown to the Langobard princess Theodelina and it has since then been housed in Monza Cathedral to be used for the coronation of Langobard Kings and the subsequent Frankish Kings of Italy."
 KLK_idea_2: "Alboino"
 KLK_idea_2_desc: "King Alboino of the Gausi dynasty was the first of the Lombard Kings to conquer Italy. Alboino had crossed the Julian Alps in 568 and quickly brought the major cities of present Lombardy under his control. The outraged Byzantine Empire organized a conspiracy with Alboino's wife and half-brother which successfully murdered him on June 28th 572, but the memory of Alboino lived on amongst the Germanic peoples and the conspirators were exiled rather than ascending to power as they had planned."
 KLK_idea_3: "Gastaldates"
 KLK_idea_3_desc: "The original Langobard Kingdom was elective rather than hereditary and was dominated by large Stem Duchies like the German Empire to its north. Each of these duchies was in turn divided into gastaldates, a special Langobard office headed by a gastald. Kings gave the gastalds judicial and martial administrative powers in each city, and the gastalds were thus often in conflict with the locally-autonomous dukes as agents of royal power."
 KLK_idea_4: "Edictum Rothari"
 KLK_idea_4_desc: "The Edictum Rothari, or Lombard Law, was promulgated in 643 AD by King Rotari under the guidance of a meeting called a Gairethinx. Comprised of 388 chapters, it comprehensively dictated laws on matters such as inheritance, criminal justice, property, and slavery. It would affect Italian legal systems for centuries to come."

But we, as lords of Italy, are the true Holy and Roman Empire."
 KLK_idea_6: "Lombard Leagues"

The League as proof of the lasting Lombard identity and the Langobard spirit that unites us in defiance of foreign encroachment."
 KLK_idea_7: "Escaping the Empire"
 KLK_idea_7_desc: "Ever since Charlemagne crossed the alps and ended the original Langobard Kingdom, Lombardy has been subject to the whims of the Frankish Holy Roman Empire. By the fifteenth century, however, extensive absenteeism by nominal Italian kings led to a collapse of Imperial authority and the region's escape from the Empire. We must embrace self-rule and take advantage of every opportunity we have to increase our autonomy."

 spanish_ducal_idea_2_desc: "Filling the pages of countless poems, epics, and romances, Rodrigo Díaz de Vivar, also known as El Cid (al-Sayyid, 'the lord'), is the most legendary of all Spanish warlords. El Cid came from a minor aristocratic family and first worked as a general for different Islamic Taifas before becoming the primary military leader of Castile-León and ultimately carving out his own independent state centered on València. His new realm was ruled with tolerance for Christians and Muslims alike, and greatly angered the Castilian King who had previously employed him. El Cid's wife continued to rule València after his death, leaving him immortalized in Spanish folk culture."
 spanish_ducal_idea_3: "Reconverting the Taifas"
 spanish_ducal_idea_3_desc: "Each new duchy and kingdom held by Christian Spaniards was created out of the ashes of old Taifas. It is one thing to take their name, it is another to change the hearts and minds of the populace.

The Kingdom of the Algarve, for instance, was considered part of the Portuguese King's titles and even appeared separately on maps. These appanages were made most famous when the Count of Trastamara in Galicia, Enrique, managed to win the entire Castilian Crown in a rebellion and put his illegitimate line on the throne for centuries to come."
 spanish_ducal_idea_5: "Santo Reino"

Guiscard was established as Count of Apulia in 1057 and quickly drove the Byzantines out of their remaining forts in Calabria and Salento, from which he began to reconquer Sicily from the Saracens for the first time in centuries. Under his rule, Latin Christianity spread through formerly Greek lands and such churches as Salerno Cathedral were founded."
 siculo_norman_idea_2: "Pilgrimage"
 siculo_norman_idea_2_desc: "The Normans first established their presence in Southern Italy, even before they began to work as mercenaries, by going on pilgrimages to Rome, Jerusalem, and Monte Gargano. According to the Salernitan Tradition, Norman pilgrims ridiculed the Lombards for paying Saracen ransom money and scared off Islamic pirates easily, which caused the Prince of Salerno to request their continued presence in the area for protection."
 siculo_norman_idea_3: "Norman Kingdom of Africa"
 siculo_norman_idea_3_desc: "Starting in the 1140s the Normans fully reversed the tide of Islamic conquests that had rocked Africa since the seventh century and put the Arab states there on the defensive. Many of the most important coastal fortresses in Tunisia fell into Norman hands, including the entire strategic island of Djerba, and these newly-conquered titles were quickly organized into a new Christian kingdom. Though it didn't last long, the Kingdom of Africa is a testament to Norman ambition and siege prowess."
 siculo_norman_idea_4: "Unite the Counties"
 siculo_norman_idea_4_desc: "When the Normans first conquered Southern Italy they divided it into hereditary counties and duchies distributed amongst various Norman families. These counties included Foggia, Bojano, Aversa, Capua, Lecce, Sicily, Malta, and many others. We should make an effort to annex these feudal titles to the crown and steer Southern Italy toward a more centralized beaurocratic system under a single noble family."
 siculo_norman_idea_5: "Greco-Arabic Influences"
 siculo_norman_idea_5_desc: "Through the process of encastellation, the Normans in Southern Italy developed a style which synthesized that of the Arabs and Byzantines who preceded them. In many cases Romanesque cathedrals and monasteries were build on lands that had only been converted from Islam and Orthodoxy immediately prior, and local talents were frequently employed."
 siculo_norman_idea_6: "French Connections"
 siculo_norman_idea_6_desc: "The Drengots and de Hautevilles had originally arrived in Italy from northern France and as such ties with the French nobility were maintained even centuries after the Norman conquest was completed. The Angevin rulers of Provence, for instance, eventually retook the Norman Kingdom of Sicily from its Germanic overlords and returned Southern Italy to French control. We are lucky to have dynastic and cultural ties to such a robust aristocracy."

 giudicati_idea_1_desc: "The Giudicato system was born out of Roman-Byzantine administrative institutions which decayed in the eighth century leading to Sardinian independence. The formerly Byzantine-appointed Archons became autonomous rulers of Sardinia, but unlike most Western feudal states their power was not absolute. Instead, the ancient traditions of the Nuragic culture of Sardinia fused with Byzantine practices to produce our unique governments."
 giudicati_idea_2: "Famiglia de Lacon"
 giudicati_idea_2_desc: "In late Byzantine Sardinia, the offices of Doux and Praeses were apparently held by a family from Laconi in Sarcidano and from Gunale in Arzachena respectively. At some point the families united into one, and when the island entered its Giudicato era each Giudicato was ruled by a branch of the family. Our dynastic ties are extensive, whether Lacon-Zori or Lacon-Gunale or Lacon-Serra."
 giudicati_idea_3: "Corona de Logu"
 giudicati_idea_3_desc: "The national assembly of each Giudicato was the Corona de Logu. This organization was made up of the aristocratic nobility and had to approve any action taken by the Giudice, nominally even having the power to elect a new Giudice in lieu of feudal inheritance. This system was codified in such documents as the 1392 Carta de Logu, and helps give the populace the illusion of checks and balances against autocracy."
 giudicati_idea_4: "Establish Curadorias"
 giudicati_idea_4_desc: "To better administer the mountainous lands of Sardinia and keep disparate villages under Giudicial authority, we should create the office of Curadora and divide each Giudicato into Curadorias. These districts will be controlled from a central village where the Curadore can execute government and local land management."
 giudicati_idea_5: "Bujakesos & Birridus"
 giudicati_idea_5_desc: "Constant piracy from Saracens and incursion from ambitious Italian states means the Sardinian Giudicati are used to warfare. Sardinia's elite soldiers were called bujakesos and carried a special weapon derived from the Roman javelin called a birrudu."
 giudicati_idea_6: "Romanesque Prestige"
 giudicati_idea_6_desc: "Due to our Byzantine ties, Sardinia developed under the auspices of Eastern Christianity and the Eastern Liturgy. However, starting at the schism of 1054, the Giudicati oriented themselves towards the Papacy and by 1092 had lost their autocephalous status. Western Monasticism spread throughout Sardinia starting with Barisone de Lacon's 1064 donation of Nostra Segnora de Mesumundu to the Benedictine Order. Later monks from the Cistercian Order, Camaldolese Order, Vallombrosian Order, and Vittorian Order arrived and Romanesque Architecture flourished at further churches like the Basilica di Saccargia and Basilica di San Gavino."
 giudicati_idea_7: "Arborean Resistance"
 giudicati_idea_7_desc: "Though most of the Giudicati fell to foreign powers - Pisa, Aragon, Genoa - by the end of the thirteenth century, Arborea managed to repel attempted invasion forces multiple times and in fact went on the offensive against Aragon throughout the 1300s, conquering virtually all of Sardinia from them. Through diplomatic maneuvering and the skill of generals like Brancaleone Doria, Arborea is an inspiration to Sardinians across the island."

Abû‘l-Jaysh Mujâhid ibn ‘Abd Allâh al‘Âmirî was the Saqlabi (Slavic) lord of Denia on behalf of the Umayyads, and launched a series of campaigns against the Giudicati of Sardinia in 1015-1016. It was said that he sent a sack of chestnuts to the Pope to illustrate all the Muslim troops that would be unleashed on Christendom, and the Pope sent back a sack of millet to show how many Christians would respond in turn. Sure enough, Mogehidus' invasions were totally thwarted by Pisa."
 PIS_idea_2: "Archdiocese of Pisa"
 PIS_idea_2_desc: "In the course of the Late Middle Ages Pisa grew exponentially to become one of Italy's most important cities and one of the four canonical maritime republics - Genoa, Venice, Pisa, and Amalfi. Pope Urban II was impressed with Pisa's contributions to the advancement of Christendom around the Mediterranean and decided to grant us nominal lordship over Corsica and Sardinia, and in a more concrete sense to elevate Pisa's bishop to an archbishop. As a metropolitan archdiocese, we will have more influence in the Holy See."

The sack of Saracen Reggio de Calabria in 1005 greatly bolstered the wealth of the city, and in 1088 the important Islamic city of Mahdia in Tunisia was sacked as well. When the First Crusade was called in the 1090s, an enormous Pisan fleet under the archbishop Dagobert helped in the capture of Jerusalem and the looting of many Byzantine islands. This allowed us to begin to establish trading points across the Levant."
 PIS_idea_4: "Alexian Rights"
 PIS_idea_4_desc: "As Pisa's connections in the East spread during the crusder era, a colony was established in Constantinople, where Alexios Komnenos granted us special trading and mooring rights. This colony grew to a full 1,000 citizens over time, and Pisa eventually became the Byzantine Empire's greatest trading martner and maritime ally in the west. These special privileges and connections will surely put us at an advantage against our rivals Venice and Genoa."
 PIS_idea_5: "Recover from Meloria"
 PIS_idea_5_desc: "The power of the original maritime republic of Pisa was utterly broken at the Battle of Meloria against Genoa in 1284. Genoa and Pisa had started out as collaborators in the fight against Saracen power, but as the Islamic threat waned petty rivalries led to further and further conflicts. Seeking to conquer Sardinia, the Genoans amassed a fleet of 88 galleys and routed the 72 galleys of Pisa, capturing most of our sailors. We must move on from this disastrous defeat, learn from our mistakes, and come back as a stronger maritime power than ever."
 PIS_idea_6: "The Leaning Tower"
 PIS_idea_6_desc: "Buscheto began the massive Piazza dei Miracoli in the eleventh century, centered around an impressive Duomo and bell tower. Shortly after construction began, however, the bell tower's inadequate foundations caused it to start leaning to one side. Over the centuries, architects like Giovanni di Simone and Tommaso di Andrea-Pisano attempted to mitigate the issue of the tower's lean, though when it was finished in 1372 it nevertheless tilted several degrees and would remain in that form throughout history, becoming perhaps the most iconic monument of Pisa and one of Italy's greatest sights."
 PIS_idea_7: "Galileo Galilei"
 PIS_idea_7_desc: "Galileo Galilei was one of the most visionary scientists of the early modern era, using telescopes to make profound astronomical observations and advance a heliocentric view of the cosmos. Galileo was a native-born Pisan before moving to Florence at age eight and starting a life of discoveries that would lead to his conflict with Tycho Brahe and the Roman Inquisition, and though his life in Pisa was thus relatively brief, he brings a degree of prestige to our University-covered city."

 SIC_TAI_idea_1: "Greek Paradise"
 SIC_TAI_idea_1_desc: "In days long gone Sicily was colonized by the Greeks. Though harassed by Carthage the city states here flourished and prospered. The city of Syracuse grew to huge proportions, eclipsing all others as the most populous Greek city."
 SIC_TAI_idea_2: "Splendor of Palermo"
 SIC_TAI_idea_2_desc: "It is hard to mention Sicily without also mentioning its shining jewel, the grand city of Palermo. The surrounding fields provide enough food, and more, for the entire city to eat. 4 springs give their water ensuring Palermo never succumbs to drought. Too many mosques to count dot the cityscape, almost every one also being a school and educating our populous. In its splendor Palermo is one of the largest cities in Europe."
 SIC_TAI_idea_3: "Agricultural Revolution"
 SIC_TAI_idea_3_desc: "When Islam came to Sicily, so did its agricultural expertise. Many scholars of the time specialized in agronomy and discovered many ways to more efficiently farm. This included: improved irrigation, proper caring for fruit trees including olive, efficient animal husbandry and many more."
 SIC_TAI_idea_4: "Byzantine Revolts"
 SIC_TAI_idea_4_desc: "Some former Byzantine citizens can't quite understand that Sicily is, and always shall be, Muslim. However they continuously revolt in petty attempts to restore the byzantine tyrants. Over the years we have become skillful at squashing these revolts, sometimes before they happen."
 SIC_TAI_idea_5: "Independent From North Africa"

 HDS_idea_1: "Damned Dammstadt"
 HDS_idea_1_desc: "Dammstadt, located not too far from Hildesheim, was profiting from the Hildesheimer trade activities, and was growing due to this. The city was becoming increasingly powerful, gaining city rights, city walls and a real market place. It started even making new settlements, the city was became a real economic competitor and most annoyingly, it was trying to influence the elections in Hildesheim. It became a real threat in the eyes of the Bishops. In 1331-1332, a double election happened, where the candidate supported by Dammstadt got elected away, and the successor prompted with an attack against Dammstadt on Christmas Eve 1332, in which it got looted and mostly destroyed. The remains of the city got integrated into the city of Hildesheim."
 HDS_idea_2: "Innerste Ford"
 HDS_idea_2_desc: "The city of Hildesheim, one of the oldest in Northern Germany, had an important market on the Hellweg trade route, as it secured the Innerste ford. The fact that the city had a cathedral, and an important market, made it grow to be one of the largest cities in Northern Germany in 1250. The first market place was laid out around the church St. Andreas. When the city grew further, a bigger market place became necessary."
 HDS_idea_3: "Tausendjähriger Rosenstock"
 HDS_idea_3_desc: "The Tausendjähriger Rosenstock, or Thousand-year Rose, is a rosa canina that climbs on the wall of Hildesheim Cathedral. It is probably the rose mentioned in a legend in the Fundatio Ecclesiae Hildensemens, an 11th-century publication. The Emperor had taken a reliquary to use when he stopped to say Mass while out hunting. The artefact was placed in a tree while the sermon was undertaken but not retrieved when the hunt resumed. Later a chaplain was unable to remove the reliquary from the branches. Believing this to be a symbol of God's will, the Emperor had a church constructed there instead of as originally planned at Elze."
 HDS_idea_4: "High Reputation Cathedral Chapter"
 HDS_idea_4_desc: "The reputation of the cathedral chapter and school was such that Hildesheim produced no fewer than forty-four bishops and archbishops, who served in dioceses from Cologne to Madgeburg and from Schleswig to Salzburg and Brixen, between 918 and 1167."
 HDS_idea_5: "Flourishment of Hildesheim during the Ottonian Era"
 HDS_idea_5_desc: "Hildesheim gained a lot of power and prosperity during the Ottonian era. A cultural revival spurred, as sovereigns and bishops, seeking the prestige of the Roman and Byzantine empires, vigorously supported the production of art, especially illuminated manuscripts and their jeweled covers, fine metalwork, and other luxury church furnishings. It was under the Ottonian kings that Hildesheim was elevated to the dynasty’s home bishopric, and the proximity to them brought the Bishops numerous privileges, including the right to mint coinage. It is during this period that medieval Hildesheim produced a massive amount of art."
 HDS_idea_6: "Hildesheim Diocesan Feud"
 HDS_idea_6_desc: "The Hildesheim Diocesan Feud was a conflict that broke out between Hildesheim and Brunswick. Due to the Prince-Bishopric's poor financial circumstances the Prince-Bishop of Hildesheim asked for the return of several estates pledged to the nobles within the realm; but a small number of them refused to give up their mortgaged property. The ruler of Brunswick sought a reason to attack neighbouring Hildesheim and found one in the disputes between the prince-bishop and the nobility; and so he started a war. Hildesheim had won a major battle at Soltau that could’ve made them win the war; but the Emperor, favoring Brunswick, used its influence and Hildesheim had to give up a lot of territory. They maybe had won militarily, but not politically."
 HDS_idea_7: "Hildesheimer Treasure"
 HDS_idea_7_desc: "The Hildesheim Treasure, unearthed on October 17 1868 in Hildesheim by Prussian soldiers, is the largest collection of Roman silver found outside imperial frontiers. Most of it can be dated to the 1st century AD, and was probably produced in frontier workshops of the Northwestern Roman provinces. The trove consists of about seventy exquisitely crafted solid silver vessels for eating and drinking. It is generally believed that the treasure was the table service of a Roman commander, perhaps Publius Quinctilius Varus, who was militarily active in Germania. However, others also suggest that the treasure may have been war spoils rather than a table service."

Tunis - under our rule - has become the new Carthage. Just as they challanged Rome in trade and military, we shall challange Italy the same."
 TUN_idea_2: "Reforms of Ibn Tumart"
 TUN_idea_2_desc: "The Almohad founder, Ibn Tumart, may be long gone but his changes made to our political and administrative system have stayed. He sought to move forward from the tribalism present in our country to a more advanced period, with offices such as the People of The House and the Ten assisting the monarch in rule."
 TUN_idea_3: "European Customs"
 TUN_idea_3_desc: "Our many dealings with the Europeans in matters of trade have led us to adopt their system of customs. All goods arriving in our ports are taken to a sealed warehouse until all tariffs and fares have been paid. It is overseen by an al-Caid, who acts as a legal authority in most matters concerning foreigners."
 TUN_idea_4: "Corsair Ports"
 TUN_idea_4_desc: "Corsairs make their home in not just the port of Tunis but many others in our Domain. They are a constant nuiscance for fleets of both trade and war of Spain and Italy, which suits us just fine."
 TUN_idea_5: "Monitored Markets"
 TUN_idea_5_desc: "Often markets can devolve into unlawful places of swindlers and pickpockets but our judge-police, muhtasib, keep the streets clean. They regulate all commercial matters, enforcing fair dealings from merchants, dealing with thieves and brigands, and regulating the value of currancy."
 TUN_idea_6: "Ibn Khaldun"
 TUN_idea_6_desc: "Ibn Khaldun was a great philosopher, sociographer and histographer. He wrote many great historical works on civilization in Arabia, North Africa and Persia. Many of his works specificialy on the Berbers would become prime sources on the subject for the future."
 TUN_idea_7: "Revanchism Against the Normans"
 TUN_idea_7_desc: "Those Normans who reside in Apulia once outragously invaded and occupied our country, forming the 'Kingdom of Africa'. We were liberated by the Almohads soon after, but the brand burns deep. We must show the Normans the power of Tunis!"

 BML_idea_1: "Ravaged Lands"
 BML_idea_1_desc: "In the Middle Medieval Ages, this region had been ravaged many times by for example the Rani. The original seat of Lübeck was even named after this: it received from the Northern Germanic Vikings the name of Brandenhuse or 'the burned houses'. The original city of Lübeck, Liubice (the lovely), had also been burned down during these times."
 BML_idea_2: "Bishop in Search of Crusaders and the Logistical Port of Lübeck"
 BML_idea_2_desc: "Lübeck was the largest German port at the Baltic Sea, and served an important logistical role during the Crusader in the Baltic lands. It not only transported many troops and supplies, but also numerous colonists, becoming also an import emigration port.\nMeanwhile the Bishop travelled to many places in Germany and the Baltic area. The purpose of these journeys was the recruiting of crusaders, usually through preaching."
 BML_idea_3: "Take over the Lübecker Trade"
 BML_idea_3_desc: "The Free City of Lübeck is the leading city in the Hanseatic trade. We should aim to get our namesake city back, and keep its wealthy trade intact. Therefore it is important to already have a considerable foothold in this trade network."
 BML_idea_4: "The Cathedral of Lübeck"
 BML_idea_4_desc: "The mighty cathedral of Lübeck had been constructed when the Bishops still resided in the city. After becoming a Free City, it still remained in the hands of the Bishop, but the provost was alternately chosen by the cathedral chapter and by the city council. It symbolises the good relations both had."
 BML_idea_5: "Only Protestant Bishopric"
 BML_idea_5_desc: "Lübeck became one of the two only Prince-Bishoprics with a Protestant ruler in the Empire, the other being Osnabrück. However, Osnabrück was only alternately led by Protestant and Catholic bishops, meaning that Lübeck was the only full Protestant bishopric. Since this Prince of the Empire could not sit on the spiritual or temporal bench at the Reichstag, it received its own cross-wise bench."
 BML_idea_6: "Coincidence?"
 BML_idea_6_desc: "Originally, the seat of this diocese was located in Oldenburg in Holstein. Because of Slavic Tribes, the bishops were for a long time not able to enter their diocese. However, when these territories were added to the Holy Roman Empire, the seat of this diocese was moved to Lübeck.\nWhen Lübeck became a Free City, the seat moved again, this time to Eutin.\nSince 1586, after the conversion to Protestantism, all elected Bishops were members of the Holstein-Gottorp line of the House of Oldenburg. Eventually Lübeck became mediatized and became part of the Grand Duchy of Oldenburg, which was named after it's capital, Oldenburg."
 BML_idea_7: "Danish Succession War for Lübeck"
 BML_idea_7_desc: "Although small as state, the Diocese comprised the Holstein-Schleswiger lands, over which the Danes had fought many conflicts. Having not the spriritual control over the lands was a thorn in their eyes. Even more since this Oldenburger-Holsteiner family constantly ruled here, it even became a kind of law that the bishop was of this family. This made it impossible to have a bishop loyal to the Danes here. When the Bishop died, the Danes started a succession war, which they eventually lost thanks to an intervention of England."

 CDZ_idea_1: "Colditz Castle"
 CDZ_idea_1_desc: "The most striking feature of the Lordship of Coldtiz was its castle, build on a cliff near a river; and this building played a huge role in the history of the town. It became the residence of the House of Colditz. The castle had gotten attacked, burned down and rebuild several times in history."
 CDZ_idea_2: "Cholidistcha"
 CDZ_idea_2_desc: "The first record of Colditz dates from 1046, when it was mentioned as a burgward on the Mulde called Cholidischa. Burgwards were a form of settlement used for the organization of the northeastern marches against the Saxons and other peoples. A burgward was composed of a central fortification, the burg, and a number of smaller, undefended villages, the wards, that depended on the burg for protection, and the burg was economically dependent on them. The burg was also the administrative center, for example used for tax collection. It was also given a garrison of cavalry, usually of Slavic origin."
 CDZ_idea_3: "Pleissenland"
 CDZ_idea_3_desc: "Pleissenland was a large, rather unexploited area with only a few towns that was in the possession of the Emperors. Colditz, strategically located in that area, had gotten special rights to make the lands arable and also to defend the place with its castle. The great efforts of the emperors to develop these lands resulted in an imperial territory that was covered with young villages, towns and monasteries."
 CDZ_idea_4: "Münzstätte Colditz"
 CDZ_idea_4_desc: "Already in the 13th century, Colditz was known for producing one-sided badges, and in the 14th century the town received the rights from the emperor to mint coins. Later, the emperor reaffirmed the right to mint and the ownership of the coins by the Lords of Colditz. The Lords probably operated a silver mine at Ulrichsberg, near Pegau."
 CDZ_idea_5: "Margarethengroschen"
 CDZ_idea_5_desc: "The so-called Margarethengroschen were  a series of (illegal) coins minted at Colditz, ordered by Margaretha, the wife of the elector of Saxony. She had the right to mint there back then. The first coins she made quickly led to a dispute, as they had her initial before that of her husband; the sequence got changed, so that now the elector appeared as the mint master. Strangely enough, at these times she was also minting coins without the special mint mark, which could lead to someone intrepid her as being an illegal coin master. She also dared to make coins with only her initials. The right to mint was reconfirmed for her, just before the death of her husband, which gave her the possibility to mint even after his death."
 CDZ_idea_6: "Development of Manufactoring"
 CDZ_idea_6_desc: "In the 17th century, cloth and linen manufacturing became important in Colditz. In the 18th century, the clay from the Colditz area started to be used in the Meissen porcelain factory, and later a ceramics factory was established in Colditz."
 CDZ_idea_7: "Other Uses of the Castle"
 CDZ_idea_7_desc: "In 1803, the castle was used as a workhouse to feed the poor, sick and and people under arrest. From 1829 onwards, it served as a mental hospital until 1924. There was during these times there was also a sanatorium for the rich present. The nazi’s converted the castle to a high-security prison, which is perhaps the period the castle has been most famous for. Although it was considered a high security prison, it had one of the greatest records of successful escape attempts. This could be owing to the general nature of the prisoners that were sent there; most of them had attempted escape previously from other prisons and were transferred to Colditz, because the Germans had thought the castle escape-proof."

 KBA_idea_2: "Modus Indorum"
 KBA_idea_2_desc: "The genius of the Hindu number and mathematical structure has been present within the Islamic world for centuries. However until recently they were unkown to Europe.

 KBA_idea_4_desc: "Bejaia's port may be home to many well-stocked trade ships, but it is also home to the Barbary pirates. They pillage and plunder many trade vessels but as long as they 'contribute' some of their earnings, we can look the other way."

These mercenaries were for example used during the American War of Independence and the Napoleonic Wars. Waldeck also provided the Prussian army with a regiment during the Franco-Prussian War which got nicknamed Das Eiserne Regiment, or the Iron Regiment."
 WDK_idea_2: "Friends Repay Debts"
 WDK_idea_2_desc: "Not long after the foundation of the country we got into financial troubles. Fortunately the ruler of Hesse and Ziegenhain was kind enough to give us loan for debt repayment, and they took care of the rest of the loans we had."
 WDK_idea_3: "Donate the Monastery of Arolsen to the Counts of Hesse"
 WDK_idea_3_desc: "As sign of trust and friendship, we donated the monastery of Arolsen, which is located near the our capital, to the Counts of Hesse. They have made of the monastery, as a sign of respect and piety, one of the most wealthy in the area. It has a notable brewery."
 WDK_idea_4: "August-Markt"
 WDK_idea_4_desc: "Waldeck’s economy was focused on the exploitation of the woods, and on fields and livestock. The town of Arolsen became a very important place to sell all these goods. It gained the right to have three markets, and in the course of time a large annual market with many market stalls and a lot of cattle, the August-Markt, was also held in Arolsen."
 WDK_idea_5: "Garrison Town"
 WDK_idea_5_desc: "The capital of Waldeck, Arolsen, was very known as a garrison town. When the troops of Waldeck were not rented to some foreign power, they resided in this city. In later periods, the barracks had grown and had given place to house the soldiers of other foreign countries. For example Belgian had for a long time a garrison here."
 WDK_idea_6: "The Pyrmont Inheritance"
 WDK_idea_6_desc: "Due to the line of the counts of Gleichen dying out, the small country of Pyrmont got inherited by the Counts of Waldeck, who called themselves from then on the Counts of Waldeck-Pyrmont. Pyrmont was very well known for its natural hot springs, and this geothermally heated water was used for therapeutic baths, hence why the city is also called Bad Pyrmont."
 WDK_idea_7: "Christian August Prinz zu Waldeck"
 WDK_idea_7_desc: "Christian August Prinz zu Waldeck was an officer of the Austrian army who climbed in rank during his career to the ranks of general and field marshal. He played a major role in the Austro-Prussian army during the war with Revolutionary France.

 VIV_idea_1: "Tumultuous Religious History"
 VIV_idea_1_desc: "Starting with the Crusades against the Cathars, the Vivarais suffered from a lot of religious aggression and wars. With the outbreak of the Reformation, many people changed faith, influenced by the nearby located center of Genève. This caused again for troubles, mainly during the revolt of the Calvinists against Louis XVII, in which the important Vivarais city of Privas was burned to the ground. And when the Edict of Nantes was revoked by Louis XIV, the Dragonnades caused many non-Catholics to flee. The war of the Canisards, a revolt of Hugenots, caused even more damage."
 VIV_idea_2: "Haut-Vivarais"
 VIV_idea_2_desc: "The Haut-Vivarais is the highest part of the Vivarais, consisting of many grasslands and forests on rocky, old vulcanic plateaus. It's a harsh environment, dry and rather windy during the summer, cold and snowy during the winter, and foggy during fall and spring. These lands have long been used by hardy shepherds."
 VIV_idea_3: "Les Châtaignerais du Vivarais"
 VIV_idea_3_desc: "The very nutrient-rich chestnuts are being cultivated for over 4000 years, completely shaping the landscape and the culture in the Vivarais. It was used as a substitute for grain, as grain could not fare well on the slopes of the region. The chestnuts of this region heavily influenced the French cuisine, especially with the popular marron glacé, as the Ardèchois chestnuts are the sweetest in the world. Also, since these nuts were collected during fall, people had more time for other jobs during spring and summer."
 VIV_idea_4: "Support from Local Barons"
 VIV_idea_4_desc: "Several local barons, like the one of Joannas, supported the Bishop in its sovereignty of the region, promising to help militarely if necassary. The Bishop also was constantly seeking to preserve the independance of the Vivarais, and managed for example to regain lost terrain from Toulouse. However, it remained very weak and couldn't compete against Lyon, the Provence or France, and to make things worse, the emperor was too weak to guarantee the independance."
 VIV_idea_5: "La Sériculture en Ardèche"
 VIV_idea_5_desc: "With the arrival of the Popes in Avignon in the early 14th century, the mulberry, whose leaves are eaten by the silk caterpillars, became introduced in the region. As it was sufficiently warm here to grow these plants, people started to cultivate their own silk, and the Vivarais became the most important silk-producing region of France. Because of a severe winter in 1709, the traditional production (olives and chestnuts) was destroyed, increasing the need to find other incomes like the sériculture.\nDuring the 1800s, the mulberry trees suffered from various diseases, and the imported seeds provided only a short-time solution. Eventually the diseases were under control, but it didn't avoid the callopse of this sector."
 VIV_idea_6: "Fortified Villages"
 VIV_idea_6_desc: "There are many fortified villages in the region, called Bastides. The rivers and the slopes made it even more difficult to capture the cities. Balazuc, Largentiere, Rochemaure... are some examples of villages that could withstand sieges very well. All the buildings were almost completely build in stone, something most people in Europe could not afford; this made the villages very fire-proof."
 VIV_idea_7: "La Mine d'Argent de Largentière"
 VIV_idea_7_desc: "The village of Largentière had been for a long time an important inditrious town. It was known, and named after, its silver mines.

With the flourishing Castilian literature such as that of 'El Cantar de Mio Cid', we can carve out our own national identity."
 CAS_idea_2: "Patronize the Guilds"
 CAS_idea_2_desc: "The wool trade is one of the staples of the Castilian economy, which has allowed several guilds and associations such as the 'Mesta' to develop that closely control the production of wool. This has created many lucrative trade opportunities as many merchants seek wool of the highest quality."
 CAS_idea_3: "The School of Toledo"
 CAS_idea_3_desc: "After the conquest of the great Arab city of Toledo in 1085, a major effort to translate the Islamic philosophical and scientific works into the languages of Europe was undertaken. To this end, the School of Toledo was established. This resulted in an unprecedented spread of knowledge which we have been able to exploit."
 CAS_idea_4: "The Order of Calatrava"
 CAS_idea_4_desc: "The Order of Calatrava was the first military order to be founded in Castile, and was confirmed in a papal bull issued in 1164. The knights of Calatrava were expert warriors and contributed extensively to the Reconquista, as a result becoming renowned across Iberia."
 CAS_idea_5: "One Crown, Several Kingdoms"
 CAS_idea_5_desc: "In 1230, the Castilian king Ferdinand III inherited the lands of the kingdom of Leon, thereby uniting them into a 'crown' of Castile. This significantly increased the power of the monarchs and set the precedent for the future establishment of kingdoms all ruled by a single monarch."
 CAS_idea_6: "Curb the Cortes of Castile"
 CAS_idea_6_desc: "The Cortes originated from advisory councils made up of powerful aristocrats and lords. They often posed problems for the monarchs due to the fact that they had to be consulted in order to raise taxes for the Reconquista. This cannot be allowed to stand for any longer; instead, we should weaken the Cortes' power so that the monarch has the final say in matters of taxation."
 CAS_idea_7: "The New World"

 FXK_idea_2: "Castle Fleckenstein"
 FXK_idea_2_desc: "The medieval castle of the Fleckenstein family was built in the early 12th century and is one of the most impressive castles in Alsace. Due to its location along a road connecting Hagenau and Kaiserslautern, the fortress gained strategic importance."
 FXK_idea_3: "United home region"
 FXK_idea_3_desc: "As early as the 13th century, the Lichtenberg family split up into several branches, of which up to four temporarily existed side by side. During this time, the land was considered and administered as a family property and not divided."
 FXK_idea_4: "Kunigunde of Fleckenstein"

 LTB_idea_1: "Alsatian field of tension"
 LTB_idea_1_desc: "Lichtenberg lies between the diocese of Metz, the diocese of Strassburg and the ambitious city of Strassburg. By entering into the right alliances with our neighbours, we can exploit these rivalries for ourselves and push ahead with our own expansion."
 LTB_idea_2: "Bailiff of Strassburg"
 LTB_idea_2_desc: "The office of the bailiff of Strassburg, which the Lichtenberg family had held since 1249, has been increasingly undermined over the years by the city's citizens. The Lichtenbergers let the citizens buy most of the rights associated with it, so that the office became more and more symbolic. On the other hand, the Lichtenbergers gained allies in this way if they wanted to take action against the bishops of Metz or Strassburg."
 LTB_idea_3: "Town privileges"
 LTB_idea_3_desc: "In 1305, Hagenau granted Lichtenberg its town privileges, which helps the economy of our nation."
 LTB_idea_4: "Lichtenberger Expansion"
 LTB_idea_4_desc: "The Lichtenberg family pursued two goals in the 13th and 14th centuries: The better protection of their ancestral castle Lichtenberg and the connection of their scattered territories to the left and right of the Rhine. The former was achieved by purchasing various castles in the vicinity of the ancestral castle, the latter only incompletely: The Lichtenberg estate could never grow together into a closed territory."
 LTB_idea_5: "Peace within the family"
 LTB_idea_5_desc: "A divided state of lordship always holds the potential of disintegration and conflict within the family. This was countered by the Lichtenberg family through an internal alliance in 1353 and two inheritance contracts. The family succeeded in handling the time of division into different lines without greater alienation of its possessions."
 LTB_idea_6: "Ludwig von Lichtenberg"
 LTB_idea_6_desc: "Jacob and Ludwig, sons of Ludwig IV von Lichtenberg, were completely opposite characters. The younger, Ludwig von Lichtenberg, had the political talent, but did not claim the leading position as the younger brother."
 LTB_idea_7: "Jakob von Lichtenberg"
 LTB_idea_7_desc: "Jacob and Ludwig, sons of Ludwig IV von Lichtenberg, were completely opposite characters. The older, Jakob von Lichtenberg, was particularly interested in science, astrology and alchemy."

 SSF_idea_1_desc: "The Hortus Deliciarum (Garden of Delicacies) is an encyclopedia written at the end of the 12th century by Herrad von Landsberg, the first work of its kind written by a woman. The illustrated work in Latin summarizes the theological and profane knowledge of that time to teach the nuns. It has been in the Strassburger district library since the late 18th century."
 SSF_idea_2: "Fought for independence"
 SSF_idea_2_desc: "When the bishop tried to curtail the rights of the city, there was an open war with the citizens. In 1262, Bishop Walter von Geroldseck was decisively defeated in the Battle of Hausbergen, and the city gained its independence from the high monastery of Strassburg. Subsequently, it developed into a free imperial city."
 SSF_idea_3: "Rivalry between Müllenheim and Zorn"
 SSF_idea_3_desc: "The Müllenheim family and the Zorn family were the most important Strassburger patrician dynasties in the Middle Ages, whose rivalry for power in the imperial city was fought in veritable street battles. The town hall was given two separate entrances, one for the Müllenheim and one for the Zorn. The two banks of the Ill river were also named after these families."
 SSF_idea_4: "Great Power of the Guilds"
 SSF_idea_4_desc: "The patriciate had to accept a serious deprivation of power after the revolts of the craftsmen in 1482: The new constitution, which applied until the French Revolution, granted two thirds of seats in the city council to the guilds."
 SSF_idea_5: "Centre of book production"
 SSF_idea_5_desc: "After Johannes Gutenberg invented letterpress printing in Europe, Strassburg quickly became an important centre of book production. The Strassburger printers made an important contribution to the spread of the Reformation, because thanks to the far-reaching religious tolerance of the city, writings of Martin Luther and other reformers could be published here already early. One third of the writings printed in the 16th century were bibles or excerpts from them."
 SSF_idea_6: "Palais Rohan"
 SSF_idea_6_desc: "The Palais Rohan was built from 1731 to 1742 on the site of the former archbishop's residence, the so-called Palatium. The new palace served the subsequent prince-bishops and cardinals from the Rohan family as a town residence, while Mutzig Castle and Saverne Castle were prince-bishops' country residences."
 SSF_idea_7: "Centre of Sturm und Drang"

 SSS_idea_3: "Sacramenta Argentariae"
 SSS_idea_3_desc: "The Oaths of Strassburg were mutual pledges of allegiance between Louis the German, ruler of East Francia, and his half-brother Charles the Bald, ruler of West Francia, made in 842. They are written in three different languages: Medieval Latin, Old Gallo-Romance and Old High German."
 SSS_idea_4: "A fragmented but large diocese"
 SSS_idea_4_desc: "The bishopric of Strassburg is very fragmented, but its size is impressive. Our army should learn to move more quickly between our territories, so that our size will not become our downfall at some point."
 SSS_idea_5: "Cathédrale Notre-Dame de Strasbourg"
 SSS_idea_5_desc: "The Strassburg Cathedral was built between 1176 and 1439 at the place of a burnt down predecessor building from the 11th century, which in turn had replaced a burnt down church from the Carolingian period. From at least 1647 to 1874, the cathedral with its 142-metre-high north tower was the tallest building in human history and the tallest one completed in the Middle Ages."
 SSS_idea_6: "Straßburger Kapitelstreit"
 SSS_idea_6_desc: "The Straßburger Kapitelstreit was a dispute between the Catholic and Protestant sides over the supremacy in the diocese of Strassburg. It ended in 1604 with a victory of the Catholic Party over the occupation of the bishop's office, which had been controversial since 1592."
 SSS_idea_7: "Jean-Baptiste Kléber"

 MBC_idea_3: "Far-reaching secular goods"
 MBC_idea_3_desc: "Murbach owned real estate and rights in approximately 350 villages. Most of them were in Alsace, in the dioceses of Strassburg and Basel. In addition, there were properties on the right bank of the Rhine and even in the Black Forest."

 MBC_idea_5: "Responsible for the rise of the Habsburgs"
 MBC_idea_5_desc: "The monastery of Murbach played a decisive role for the up-and-coming Habsburg dynasty, not least because they had received extensive fief from the monastery as bailiffs of Murbach. We should apply this diplomatic expertise to our neighbours, rivals and vassals in the future."
 MBC_idea_6: "Founders of Lucerne"
 MBC_idea_6_desc: "Lucerne was probably founded by the von Eschenbach brothers, who owned the Abbey of Murbach and Lucerne simultaneously at the end of the 12th century. In the future we should rather establish new cities in our own territory and expand existing ones with impressive buildings."
 MBC_idea_7: "Extensive privileges"
 MBC_idea_7_desc: "Since its foundation, the monastery of Murbach had extensive privileges, including the free choice of the abbot. In 1544, Emperor Charles V granted the abbey the right to mint the silver won on its holdings. In 1548, Emperor Ferdinand I granted the abbey the rank of a prince abbey with seat and vote in the Reichstag."

 ALS_idea_1: "Influenced by Germanic and Romanic culture"
 ALS_idea_1_desc: "Alsace is characterised by the fruitful influence of two of Europe's major cultural areas: Germanic (German) and Latin (French). After the Migration Period, we were first Germanized and incorporated into the cultural currents of German history. Since modern times, we have increasingly come under the political control of the French kingdom."
 ALS_idea_2: "Alsatian dialect"
 ALS_idea_2_desc: "The Alsatian dialect is one of the strongest pillars of regional identity, the legacy of numerous historical movements. Although the Alsatian dialect is based on the Alemannic dialects, it differs from German because many words have been taken from French."
 ALS_idea_3: "Alsatian tolerance"
 ALS_idea_3_desc: "The Jewish communities are strongly represented in Alsace, especially in comparison to inner France. The reason for this was that in the Middle Ages the Jews were completely expelled from France, while we tolerated them."
 ALS_idea_4: "Alsatian pottery"
 ALS_idea_4_desc: "Pottery has been practiced in Alsace since the Renaissance, especially in Betschdorf and Soufflenheim. In the village Betschdorf remarkable pottery is offered, whose production technique has remained unchanged since 1717."
 ALS_idea_5: "Trade centre in the middle of Europe"
 ALS_idea_5_desc: "Alsace lies in the heart of Europe, which is why many traders use our roads to transport goods from north to south and from east to west. We should use our position to influence trade routes according to our own wishes and advantages."
 ALS_idea_6: "Hop growing & brewery"
 ALS_idea_6_desc: "Besides viticulture, hop growing and brewing are also an important economic sector in Alsace; half of French beer production comes from Alsace, especially from the Strassburg area such as Schiltigheim and Obernai. Kronenbourg has been brewed in Strassburg since 1664."
 ALS_idea_7: "Alsatian traditional costume"
 ALS_idea_7_desc: "The traditional Alsatian costume dates back to the 18th century. In the early days, when the traditional costumes were made by farmers, they were made of linen, flax or bombazine. Later the farmers turned to industrially produced products. The size of the new panels allowed pleats and a more generous cut. Vivid colours came to life: shining white and bright red. Blue, green, violet and black complete the colour palette."

 ADU_idea_1_desc: "Centuries of close contact with Christians and Jews has left an undeniable mark on many aspects of Andalusian Society, for better or for worse. One shining example of how it has benefited us positively is the intermarriage of different architectural styles, resulting in a distinctly colourful and instantly recognizable way of construction."
 ADU_idea_2: "Libraries of Cordoba"
 ADU_idea_2_desc: "Over the decades the City of Cordoba has amassed a collection of literature, unchallenged in Christian lands, rivaled only by the famed Libraries of Baghdad. Unlike much of the Christian World, we have long believed literacy and knowledge to be not dangers but needed for the advancement of society and consequently available to the public; it is this that has allowed us to produce some of the brightest minds in the history of Mathematics and Science."
 ADU_idea_3: "Umayyad Raiders"
 ADU_idea_3_desc: "Muslim Hispania was established in the 8th Century by the Umayyad commander Tariq ibn Ziyad, who directed a small but mobile force of raiders. The strategy of lightning-quick forces dealing devastating blows to the enemy originates from the time of the Prophet, and is one that we have continued to use this day."
 ADU_idea_4: "Arab Agricultural Revolution"
 ADU_idea_4_desc: "The Arab Agricultural Revolution lasted from the 8th century to the 13th century and was largely based in Andalusia. New technologies and methods of farming allowed crops to survive harsher and longer droughts, prevented land degradation, and saved countless hours for labouring farmers; this is due largely to our tradition of academic achievement and appreciation of knowledge in any form."
 ADU_idea_5: "Title of Caliph"
 ADU_idea_5_desc: "The Caliph is the ultimate figurehead and authority of all of Islam, much like the Pope is of Catholicism, except the Caliph does much more than sit all day doing nothing but wear a pointed hat. Only one legitimate Caliph may exist at a given time, as he is the religious successor to the final Prophet sent from God, and it just so happens that now it is the time for Al-Andalus to proclaim the righteous Caliph, instead of false Abbasid pretenders."
 ADU_idea_6: "Patronage of Arts"
 ADU_idea_6_desc: "A tradition of Andalusian rulers was a competition of Art Patronage, with each ruler outdoing the previous and leading to world-famous art and architecture in our realm. Now that we are the ultimate authority not just for Andalusia, but Islam as a whole, we shall continue this tradition and show the non-Muslim World the masterpieces of art we are capable of creating."
 ADU_idea_7: "Crossroads of East and West"
 ADU_idea_7_desc: "Andalusia has historically been a Centre of Trade, as well as a vital link between the Muslim and Christian Worlds.

 VNN_idea_2: "Legacy of the Lombards"
 VNN_idea_2_desc: "In the year of 569, after the collapse of the Roman Empire, Verona was conquered by Alboin, King of the Lombards, and transformed into perhaps the second-most vital city within his realms; the Lombards would ultimately come to conquer much of the Italian peninsula, becoming the first to do so after the Romans."
 VNN_idea_3: "Veronese League"
 VNN_idea_3_desc: "In 1164 Verona joined with the cities of Vicenza, Padua, and Treviso to create the Veronese League, which would later combine with the larger Lombard league to defeat the Holy Roman Emperor Frederick Barbarossa. Contacts and alliances made during this time serve us even to this day."
 VNN_idea_4: "Conquest of Brescia"
 VNN_idea_4_desc: "Lord Mastino II was perhaps the richest ruler in all of Europe after the King of France and is this city's most revered leader. His actions led to the conquest of neighbouring Brescia in 1332 as well as the later purchase of the cities of Parma and Lucca, projecting our power throughout Northern Italy."
 VNN_idea_5: "The 48 Towers"
 VNN_idea_5_desc: "The Skyline of our humble Commune has long been dominated by the 48 towers, making our city's beauty known across the lands. It is only due to the superiority of Veronese Architects that we have been able to construct such a Skyline."
 VNN_idea_6: "Cangrande, Patron of the Arts"
 VNN_idea_6_desc: "Cangrade della Scala was not only a brilliant military leader, but also a Patron of the Arts; he would commission countless pieces of art as well as become the primary source of funding for poet Dante Alighieri."
 VNN_idea_7: "The Art of Bellringing"

 VLK_idea_3: "Coin Minting"
 VLK_idea_3_desc: "One of the reasons that the taifa of Valencia rose to prominence among the Muslim states of Iberia was that it minted its own coins, a big boon for the Valencian economy."
 VLK_idea_4: "Roman Construction"
 VLK_idea_4_desc: "Valencia was built by the Romans in days that are now long gone. If we study the techniques used by the Romans in building this city, then we can implement them into our building stratagem and lessen our expenditures."
 VLK_idea_5: "Mediterranean Leverage"
 VLK_idea_5_desc: "The merchants of Valencia, renowned throughout the entire Mediterranean, have always been a mixed group of people, including Berbers, Christians, Franks, Jews, and many others. This diversity and renown gives us leverage in Eastern Iberian and general European trade."

 PCA_idea_4: "Ambitious Counts"
 PCA_idea_4_desc: "The counts of Portucale had far-reaching ambitions; several times they tried to throw off the Galician and Leonese yoke. Although these attempts have thus far been unsuccessful, we can exploit the weaknesses in these kingdoms to our own benefit."
 PCA_idea_5: "Portuguese Identity"
 PCA_idea_5_desc: "Initially, a common language was shared with our Galician neighbours in the north, but over time it has diverged into separate dialects, one such being Portuguese. This will be an important factor in staking our claim to nationhood."
 PCA_idea_6: "Trade on the Douro"
 PCA_idea_6_desc: "The Douro is the third-longest river in Iberia and flows through our territory to the sea. It is imperative that we take advantage of the trading opportunities created by commerce with cities across the river."
 PCA_idea_7: "Precursor to Portugal"

 CRD_idea_2: "A Unique Government"
 CRD_idea_2_desc: "After the disintegration of the caliphate in 1031, the city was deprived of a leader, and so the people chose Abu Hazm of the Banu Jwahar to govern them. This initiated a new republican system of government."

This rock can be seen particularly well in the vineyards and the Seltenbachschlucht east of Klingenberg. The sandstones of different colours are layered there partly at an angle, depending on the direction of flow of the water at the time the rock is deposited."
 KLG_idea_2: "Clingenburg"
 KLG_idea_2_desc: "The Hohenstaufen Clingenburg was built in 1177 by Conradus Colbo, an imperial cupbearer who belonged to Barbarossa's circle of confidants.

 KLG_idea_5: "Three churches"
 KLG_idea_5_desc: "The oldest of the three churches in Klingenberg is Saint Pancras, situated in a prominent position above the old town. The Gothic choir and sacristy date from the 15th century, the church tower and the nave were built in 1617 with money from the property of the mother church of Saint Michael in Grubingen."
 KLG_idea_6: "Klingenberger City Palace"

Since 1741 the castle courtyard had a rose garden with tea houses built in a French style."
 KLG_idea_7: "Klingenberger clay"
 KLG_idea_7_desc: "The famous Klingenberger clay is used as an admixture to graphite in the pencil industry, for example.

 EBX_idea_4: "Elevation to the status of imperial counts"
 EBX_idea_4_desc: "The elevation to the status of imperial counts and thus to the high nobility took place in 1532, after the Erbacher had already been considered members of the high nobility since the 13th/14th century despite their origin from the imperial ministeriales."

 MBK_idea_2: "Mosbacher palace"
 MBK_idea_2_desc: "The beginnings of the palace in Mosbach as a fortified castle probably go back to the Staufer period. The manor house existed even before Otto I made Mosbach a residence and was considerably extended by the Palatine counts in the 15th century with new buildings. The castle served the Heidelberger Electors as a refuge from epidemics several times, because even then Mosbach, unlike Heidelberg, was off the main travel routes."
 MBK_idea_3: "Collegiate Church of Saint Juliana"
 MBK_idea_3_desc: "The denomination of our city changed several times between the Catholic, Lutheran and Reformed faiths. As a sign of tolerance, our collegiate church has been used by both Reformed and Catholics for services since 1698."
 MBK_idea_4: "Administrative city"

 MBK_idea_5: "Legend of the Lumbeglöggle"
 MBK_idea_5_desc: "According to the legend of the Lumbeglöggle, Countess Johanna got lost hunting in the forest. Because her husband Otto I had the rag bell of Mosbach rung continuously, Johanna was able to return to the city the same evening. The knowledge of finding a way back to our homeland with the bell inspires our soldiers."
 MBK_idea_6: "The Palm'sche Haus"

 WEE_idea_2: "Bronnbach Monastery"
 WEE_idea_2_desc: "Bronnbach Monastery, founded in 1151 by Cistercian monks, helps us to convert heretics among our subjects more quickly to the true faith."
 WEE_idea_3: "Right of coinage"
 WEE_idea_3_desc: "In 1363, Count Eberhard of Wertheim was granted the right to mint coins and to draw financial profit from them. As a result, we can handle our currency particularly well."
 WEE_idea_4: "Fishing and shipping guild"
 WEE_idea_4_desc: "Due to its location at the Main and Tauber rivers, shipping traffic has always been important in Wertheim. The first documented mention of a shipping and fishing guild dates back to 1495, when wine, grain and cloth in particular were shipped down the river to Frankfurt; however, there was already highly developed passenger shipping."
 WEE_idea_5: "Protestant parish"
 WEE_idea_5_desc: "After the Lutheran confession had been fully executed in Wertheim by 1530, no other confessions were permitted apart from the Lutherans. Even the Counter-Reformation during the Thirty Years' War could not prevail in Wertheim."
 WEE_idea_6: "Maior minoris esca"
 WEE_idea_6_desc: "During the 3rd Würzburger feud Wertheim was besieged by the Würzburger bishop and surrounding villages were burned. After the defeat of Wertheim, our entire territory on the left bank of the Main was confiscated by Würzburg. Our troops will fight more disciplined from now on to prevent such impertinence in the future."
 WEE_idea_7: "House of the Four Crowned"
 WEE_idea_7_desc: "In the centre of our town, the House of the Four Crowned was built in the 16th century to commemorate four patron saints of the stonecutters.

 DSD_idea_1_desc: "Darmstadt is located directly on the northern part of the Bergstraße, which gives the city an immense economic advantage over other cities in the region."
 DSD_idea_2: "Trade centre between Frankfurt, Worms and Speyer"
 DSD_idea_2_desc: "In 1330, Emperor Louis the Bavarian granted Count Wilhelm I. von Katzenelnbogen the city rights for Darmstadt. With the associated market rights, the importance of the previously rather inconspicuous settlement grew rapidly and the entire economy in the surrounding area focused on the Darmstadt market, while Darmstadt itself focused on the older and larger cities of Frankfurt, Worms and Speyer."
 DSD_idea_3: "Two city centres"
 DSD_idea_3_desc: "In the middle of the 13th century the counts of Katzenelnbogen built a moated castle near Darmstadt. In defence, knights gradually settled south of the castle. Since the original peasant population lived east of the castle, two settlement cores formed separated from the Darmbach river, which were originally also administered separately."
 DSD_idea_4: "Katzenelnbogener secondary residence"
 DSD_idea_4_desc: "In the course of the 14th and 15th centuries, the Counts of Katzenelnbogen repeatedly extended and rebuilt the castle until it finally became a prestigious castle in the middle of the 15th century. Darmstadt became Katzenelnbogener secondary residence and experienced a first high phase of its development."
 DSD_idea_5: "Ackerbürgerstadt till 1695"
 DSD_idea_5_desc: "After parts of Darmstadt were destroyed by the French in 1693, the construction of a new suburb was initiated. As a result, Darmstadt finally also changed structurally from a farming community town to a royal seat."
 DSD_idea_6: "Compulsory schooling since 1590"
 DSD_idea_6_desc: "During the reign of George I of Hesse-Darmstadt, Darmstadt experienced positive times and was spared from wars. As a result, the city's economy, prosperity and population grew rapidly. He made school attendance a prerequisite for the confirmation and thus introduced de facto compulsory school attendance."
 DSD_idea_7: "A touch of enlightenment in the midst of absolutism"
 DSD_idea_7_desc: "During the reign of Ernst Ludwig of Hesse-Darmstadt, numerous political reforms were carried out in Darmstadt during the first half of the 18th century. He planned the settlement of Huguenots, allowed - despite considerable resistance from the city council - the Jews to hold services and later even the establishment of a synagogue and also the Catholics were allowed to hold private services for a while."

 BMS_idea_1: "Speyer Cathedral School"
 BMS_idea_1_desc: "Bishop Balderich, one of the most learned men of his time, founded the cathedral school in Speyer at the end of the 10th century according to the example of St. Gallen, which was to become one of the most important in the empire. Among the Salian and Hohenstaufen emperors, the Speyer bishops and students of the cathedral school increasingly assumed the role of governors and functionaries of the empire. Speyer seemed to take on the character of a royal city or imperial city."
 BMS_idea_2: "Speyer Cathedral"
 BMS_idea_2_desc: "The Salian king and later Emperor Conrad II had the cathedral built around 1025 with the aim of building the largest church in the Occident. After its consecration in 1061, the cathedral included a western building, a nave with three aisles and a transept. The choir was flanked by two towers. Almost 20 years after its completion, Henry IV had half of the cathedral demolished in order to rebuild it even larger."
 BMS_idea_3: "Ecclesiastical Immunity"
 BMS_idea_3_desc: "For a long time, the increase in power of the bishops of Speyer knew no end. Otto the Great granted Speyer the immunity privilege, his own jurisdiction and control over coins and customs. As a result, the counts retired as a power factor in the city and Speyer finally fell under the protection, control and rule of the bishops. With the right to mint coins, Speyer developed into one of the most important minting places in the empire by the 12th century."
 BMS_idea_4: "Location on the Rhine"
 BMS_idea_4_desc: "Of great importance for Speyer's development was its favourable location on the Rhine, a central Central European traffic artery. The immediate proximity to the river on the flood-safe high bank was an advantage, as was the nearby mouth of the Neckar valley into the Rhine plain, which established the connection to the southeast in the direction of the Danube, and the proximity of the Kaiserslautern valley, which switched traffic to the west and southwest."
 BMS_idea_5: "Speyergau"
 BMS_idea_5_desc: "Speyergau was a county of the Salians, which extended in the surroundings of the city of Speyer. The Salians are considered the second founders of Speyer; with them the city moved into the centre of imperial politics and became the spiritual centre of Salian kingship. With the election of Conrad II as German King the targeted promotion of the city and church began, which was also continued by the Staufer family."
 BMS_idea_6: "Birthplace of Ashkenazic culture"
 BMS_idea_6_desc: "In the Middle Ages, Worms, Mainz and Speyer were praised as Rhenish Jerusalem because of the spiritual charisma of the flourishing Jewish communities there. They were of formative importance for Western European Jewry and are therefore regarded as the birthplace of Ashkenazic culture."
 BMS_idea_7: "Metropolis Germaniae"
 BMS_idea_7_desc: "On the occasion of the burial of Emperor Henry V in Speyer Cathedral in 1125, an English monk called Speyer the 'Metropolis Germaniae' (capital of Germany). This is an expression of our political importance within the Holy Roman Empire."

 SPY_idea_1: "Drapery trade"
 SPY_idea_1_desc: "The main pillar of the economy was cloth production and trade, on which about 15 % of the population depended. Taking into account ancillary industries that depended on cloth production, such as wool combers, spinners, walkers, dyers, the proportion was even higher. The cloth export went to the North and Baltic Sea, Silesia, Transylvania and Switzerland."
 SPY_idea_2: "Big Freedom Letter"
 SPY_idea_2_desc: "On the day his father was buried in Speyer Cathedral in 1111, Henry V granted the city further privileges. The Great Freedom Charter was the first city in Germany to grant citizens personal freedoms, and the granting of these citizens' privileges marked the beginning of the development into a free imperial city. This letter became a model for other cities in the empire. What became clear for the first time with these privileges was the developing interest of the empire in strengthening the bourgeoisie as a counterweight to episcopal power."
 SPY_idea_3: "Conspiracies within the city fortifications"
 SPY_idea_3_desc: "The second half of the 14th century was dominated by rivalries between influential Speyern families, which led to armed conflicts and conspiracies. The best known is a plot within the city council, which was uncovered in 1386 and is the basis of a rivalry between the Frispecher and Fritze families."
 SPY_idea_4: "Speyern Landwehr"
 SPY_idea_4_desc: "The free imperial city of Speyer built up the Speyern Landwehr in 1410 as a supplement to its city wall, i.e. an advance city fortification and boundary of a part of the city area. Watchtowers were built on the roads to the neighbouring villages where they crossed the wall."
 SPY_idea_5: "Protestation at Speyer"
 SPY_idea_5_desc: "The protestation at Speyer in 1529 by the Protestant princes against the decision of the Reichstag was a world-historically significant event in Speyer: even if this protest was only a legal act for the time being, it sealed the separation of the Christian Church of Western Europe. The Protestation of the princes and cities is regarded as the birth of Protestantism and since then the followers of the Reformation movement have been called Protestants."
 SPY_idea_6: "Center of Internal Imperial Diplomacy"
 SPY_idea_6_desc: "In the 16th century more than 50 Hoftage, 5 Imperial Diets, as well as several Imperial Deputation Diets, Elector's Diets and Imperial Moderation Diets took place in Speyer. In addition, the Imperial Chamber Court had been in Speyer for more than 150 years since 1527."
 SPY_idea_7: "Chronica der freien Reichsstadt Speier"
 SPY_idea_7_desc: "In 1612, after ten years of work, the first edition of the 'Chronica der freien Reichsstadt Speier' by Christoph Lehmann was published.

 KGG_idea_4_desc: "In 1565, Johann Jakob von Königsegg purchased Rothenfels off of his brother-in-law. This added substantially to his realm, and therefore the successful and peaceful acquisition of this land led to better treatment from local counties and abbacies."
 KGG_idea_5: "Split of the Barony"
 KGG_idea_5_desc: "In 1622, Königsegg split into Königsegg-Aulendorf and Königsegg-Rothenfels. As a result of this, regions under the house of Königsegg became more able to think independently, since the rulers were seperate."

 ANJ_ideas_bonus: "Angevin Ambitions"
 ANJ_idea_1: "Only True Heir"
 ANJ_idea_1_desc: "We, the dukes of Anjou, are directly related to the powerful Angevin dynasty. There are many who claim this honor, but we own this very hinterland, the theoretical heart of the empire. While the medieval age may pass, the age of dynastic empires never will."
 ANJ_idea_2: "Realm of diversity"
 ANJ_idea_2_desc: "Our home dynasty once united such varied cultures from across Europe that the wisest men could not speak even half of the languages spoken in Angevin kingdom and duchies. Each of the Angevins had to adapt. We need for our rulers to not be distant monarchs, far away from the common people's problems, but to be caring and protective for every culture that inhabits their realm."
 ANJ_idea_3: "Legacy of dynastic conflicts"
 ANJ_idea_3_desc: "It is not easy to persuade people into fighting for succession, since most of common folk do not care about from where their suzerain comes, until he decides to close up with them – but this can be made only after winning said war! When we are in need of regular armies, we have an advantage though: Italian condottieri, Hungarian riders, French raubritters, and even Gallowglasses from the British Isles are for our disposal... Not cheaply though. However, we have some experience in gaining lower prices, since dynastic conflicts of our dynasty tormented Europe for nearly 200 years."
 ANJ_idea_4: "Advanced Dynastic Management"
 ANJ_idea_4_desc: "Once upon a time king of Bohemia Vaclav III fought with Charles Robert d'Anjou for the Crown of St. Stephen. Then, he was murdered. Although some evidence, we mantain, proves that the assassin was a little chubby girl trained from childhood to be professional killer, we must admit that she created a great advantage for us and she deserved a cookie. We shall call the art of monarch elimination 'Advanced Dynastic Management' and teach it to our spies abroad, to help us in incoming dynastic struggles. Even if we don't murder anybody along the way, spying efficiency will rise."
 ANJ_idea_5: "Apocalypse Tapestry"
 ANJ_idea_5_desc: "Our proud heritage of cultural supremacy is best marked by enormous tapestry presenting the end of all times, once commissioned by duke Louis. When a story is so terrifying, enlarging it to hundreds of feet of artfully-woven cloth results in inevitable shock and obedience to the will of God Himself. And who is the man chosen by the Lord's will to rule these lands? Yes, that's right... you. No man will flinch on the battlefield when they know obedience to the duke is obedience to a powerful God, and whoever dies will be resurrected right after the Dies Irae he saw on the tapestry."
 ANJ_idea_6: "Chateaux of Loire Valley"
 ANJ_idea_6_desc: "Among abundant fields of artichoke and asparagus, vineyards, and berry bushes stand, like white mountains shading the Loire valley, simultaneously mighty and delicate chateauxs. In those palace-fortresses dwells the elite of our glorious country. They can be proud of their homes, since their castles shine with the splendour of the Renaissance on all Europe."
 ANJ_idea_7: "Tuffeau"
 ANJ_idea_7_desc: "Those chateauxs we may boast about are beautiful for a reason: they are built using tuffeau: light, radiant stone that continues to impress foreigners when they see villages of it, bathed in sunlight. Expanded stone-mining industry makes it easier for us to lower construction costs, although I believe it is the pleasure of working with such wonderful material which makes bulidings cheaper."

 HiberNor_idea_1: "Invaders in Decline"
 HiberNor_idea_1_desc: "What is happening now might be the end of our dominance in Eire. Following Strongbow, we almost conquered and civilised this island – but lack of support from Britain was one of many reasons for our failure. If we are to at least keep our current position, we have to prepare for conflict, and the best way to do this is keeping trust in the prime source of Norman success: mounted knights."
 HiberNor_idea_2: "Gaelic Assimilation"
 HiberNor_idea_2_desc: "It rarely happens that new settlers don't accept parts of the neighboring culture as their own, and they often even adopt their way of life and language, especially if your neighbors have some hearty jigs. It may be possible we are not real strangers anymore, but the same folk as the Irish; and while some say we became 'more Irish then the Irish' we are proud of our mixed heritage."
 HiberNor_idea_3: "Tower Houses"
 HiberNor_idea_3_desc: "Invaders are never welcome, and so we were. Our first manors had to be tiny fortresses. Although in the incoming age of gunpowder they have no use in real warfare, they will effectively nip any attempts of local rebellions in the bud."
 HiberNor_idea_4: "Legacy of Conquests"
 HiberNor_idea_4_desc: "Irishmen who perceived us as Englishmen would be shocked if they knew how many cultures we have assimilated into: French, Anglo-Saxon, Sicilian, Greek, perhaps even Arabian in some time. Such was the energy of our ancestors, they've left their influence all over the world. We have plenty of states where we can search for common ground and understanding."
 HiberNor_idea_5: "Feudal Emissaries"
 HiberNor_idea_5_desc: "The English have allegedly brought the Irish a more 'civilised' form of goverment by establishing feudalism. Former counties were split into so-called cantreds. Although our assimilated culture has turned this feudalism into a more clan-like form, we have a great advantage in terms of connection with numerous subjects and eventual lieges."
 HiberNor_idea_6: "Statutes of Kilkenny"
 HiberNor_idea_6_desc: "Attemps of turning our culture back to 'proper' English haven't succeeded, as the Crown didn't have enough power to enforce them. Right now, however, the Crown has no power at all and we are vunerable to enemy invasions. The only useful thing we could bring out from these Statutes is advice to train more of our settlers in tradional English fighting sports like archery or lancing, so that more citizens of our realm will have the opportunity to effectively stand in defence of our homeland."
 HiberNor_idea_7: "Settlement Experience"
 HiberNor_idea_7_desc: "As with most states that relied heavily on settlers, we have much experience in arranging for more potential folks coming to the wild land just around the corner. After all, our hearts may be Irish, but our minds and bodies still serve the English purpose!"

 CrusaderS_idea_2: "Another Crusaders' Kings"
 CrusaderS_idea_2_desc: "Great names like Godefroid de Bouillon or Guy de Lusignan are, unfortunately, relics of the past: times are changing, and we don't need either feudal scrambles or brave knights in shining armor, which are so easy to shoot through! We will end with the old order, but never overlook a need for a large number of sons: all their bad traits and flaws seemingly lose any meaning, and there will be no problem with having many children: local maids are swarthy and voluptuous..."

Trade with Venice and Genoa is profitable enough that if I were to give one florin to a beggar for each ten thousand florins some merchant gains, he would be rich by midnight! Let us profit from this, for there is no other way to India that through the East! Those foolish Portuguese, how they can think they can sail south and find passage there? Nay, nay, there are monsters there! Dumb Iberians..."

 CrusaderS_idea_4_desc: "When you reach the countryside, everything is dry, as sand or my head this morning. Often even wells in abandoned villages are dry, and pity on he who encounters such a well during his march. It is critical for us to secure water supplies and be ready for future campaigns against the heretics."
 CrusaderS_idea_5: "Crusader Marines"
 CrusaderS_idea_5_desc: "Italian mercenary fleets we hired to reach Constantinople were often ill suited for fighting. We should create our own armadas, and embark them with some of the greatest warriors mankind has ever seen. Those will be Crusader Marines, and they shall know no fear!"
 CrusaderS_idea_6: "Ordos Militans"
 CrusaderS_idea_6_desc: "He who has piety in his heart, sword in his hand, blue blood in his veins, dust in his chests, and a tiny swathe of land should join a militant order and sacrifice his life for the greater good, fighting heathen and heretic. He would best do this job, however, by simply becoming an officer, inspiring and introducing his men to strict monastic discipline. If we manage to get a whole cadre of these officers, our armies would become unstoppable."
 CrusaderS_idea_7: "Brothers in faith"
 CrusaderS_idea_7_desc: "Everyone wants to be saved, but not everyone can or will crusade overseas. So, through giving us gifts, military backup, or filthy lucre they get what they want. The notion that we are the guardians of our Lord's footsteps creates a worldwide reputation of us as honest (hah!), proud men, which is beneficial for our diplomatic look, not only among grateful brothers in faith.

We are proud dukes of the place where modern history formed, and we should strive to have as many men as possible to recreate ancient empires."
 TOU_idea_2: "Spanish March"
 TOU_idea_2_desc: "Similarly to Champagne, we also were an independent country, located on what was once the so-called Marca Hispanica of the Frankish Empire. Beyond the Pyrenees, Arabic invaders could always find prepared fortresses, assembled troops, and battle-hardened people. To a second Tours!"
 TOU_idea_3: "Center of Occitania"
 TOU_idea_3_desc: "Our county is undisputably the birthplace of high and sophisticated Occitain culture. We would clearly be the foremost in arts and science – if not for corrupted crusaders and the vile kings of France. It hasn't been long since those times -  now that we are free, whe should regain our affluence!"
 TOU_idea_4: "Consistori del Gay Saber"
 TOU_idea_4_desc: "Consistory of the Gay Science isn't about finding new ways for spoiled young nobles to sodomise themselves – its something created to preserve fine chants and songs of troubadours for future Occitain generations. We should promote poetry for contenting young nobles in more moral way, preserving lenga d'Oc and keeping our country stable."
 TOU_idea_5: "Capitouls"
 TOU_idea_5_desc: "The city of Toulouse began to free itsel from feudal laws early, and in 1152 'Capitouls' was founded, an assembly of city administrators that rivaled the count and fought for burghers' rights. Giving our cities privileges might be useful, when it bears us larger control over trade..."
 TOU_idea_6: "The Perfecti"
 TOU_idea_6_desc: "Seeing the incoming wave of Enlightment sprawling across Europe, we might expect that from villages hidden deep in Languedoc hills Cathar preachers will come: the Perfecti, living ascetic lifestyles and teaching people about who really created the world and who is really worshipped by Catholic priests. We should take advantage and either use them as priests of New Christianity or learn their methods and hunt down the Good Men once for all."
 TOU_idea_7: "Remember the Montsegur"
 TOU_idea_7_desc: "None can say Good Men were sinners, without being a sinner himself. None can say Cathars were vile and malicious, without being vile and malicious himself. None can say crusaders saved the souls of people they burned at stakes, without having his soul bound eternally to the Satanic construct of Earth. Yet they said those lies, and repeat them while walking upon ashes of murdered people, and we may justly tell our troops, marching on to fight enemies of Toulouse, paraphrasing words of Arnaud Amaury, butcher of Beziers: kill them all, Satan will sort out his own."

 CHP_idea_1: "Royal Seneschals"
 CHP_idea_1_desc: "All courtiers in the French royal court had to obey a seneschal: he also administrated royal domains and replaced the King in many matters when he was absent. Such great power in the Kingdom of France was hereditary to counts of Champagne: now one of the contestants for the throne in Paris. Our past gives us great knowledge in civil matters and administration."
 CHP_idea_2: "Champagnian independence"
 CHP_idea_2_desc: "It is imperative for us to know that we were nearly an independent county; we definitely have the most experience in how to be sovereign rulers, and it shows."
 CHP_idea_3: "Champagne Fairs"
 CHP_idea_3_desc: "In latter days Champagnian fairs were a main contributor to abundance and prosperity in Champagne. Incorporation of Champagne into France made them lose their importance. We are independent, for now, and should strive to make cities like Provins and Brie full of Italian merchants again."
 CHP_idea_4: "Battle of Chalons"
 CHP_idea_4_desc: "It is on our ground where Hunnic hordes were stopped and crushed by Aetius, the Last Roman. We are proud to host such sacred ground, and we are bound to learn from Romans abount their tactics and strategy, which saved Europe from utter destruction."
 CHP_idea_5: "Cathedral of Reims"
 CHP_idea_5_desc: "In the cathedral in our capital the Kings of France had to be crowned, and that gives us a great advantage in uniting the shattered country – we already have the required place of coronation. While our architects and engineers work on strenghtening its defence, we should learn how to strenghten the ties between duchies that will bow to us when we unite France."
 CHP_idea_6: "Thibaut the Troubadour's Chants"
 CHP_idea_6_desc: "One of counts of Champagne and King of Navarre as well, Thibaut de Blois, was a famous crusader and poet. The Renaissance wave that arrived in our lands from Italy might cause a revolution in our arts and poetry, but his call to holy war will never be drowned out: \nQui n'a en soi pitié ni souvenance,  \nAu haut Seigneur doit chercher sa vengeance,  \nEt délivrer sa terre et son pays."
 CHP_idea_7: "Champagne"
 CHP_idea_7_desc: "Our wines were always highly prized, but one monk known as Dom Perignon was said to have invented a wine that became famous not only as the drink of royalty and great people, but also as 'the wine of civilization'; a beverage that is somewhat like a landmark of the West and its whole cultural heritage. Considering its taste... words can't describe it. Poetry merely offers a weak facsimile. One can only drink it to know what Champagne is, and through its bubbles new ideas flow into the minds of great politicians and kings. Cork pops will sign great Champagnian military victories and successes of science and diplomacy."

 KOL_idea_1_desc: "The ancient heritage of our beloved city is represented well even by its name: we were a Roman colony, hence 'Cologne'. But it is not only former glory and ruins we can be proud of: we will always stand tall versus any invader, like the ancient inhabitants of our homeland."
 KOL_idea_2: "Archchancellor of Italy"
 KOL_idea_2_desc: "We don't know why the title 'Archchancellor of Italy' has been passed to somebody who resides hundreds of miles beyond the Alps, but no matter how far we are from our 'domains' we keep in hand the powerful tool of Italian-style diplomacy. The prestige of carrying the highest honours in the Reich attracts cunning diplomats to our palace in Bonn."
 KOL_idea_3: "Kurfurst und Burgmeister"
 KOL_idea_3_desc: "Why in Bonn, and not in Cologne? Well, the truth is that constant conficts between the Archbishop and burghers resulted in the secession of our nominal capital as the Free City Cologne. We should rethink our opinions on trade and divine supremacy, and turn the other cheek: if we will establish an agreement, we can get access to lucrative Rhine commerce in the richest of inland Hanseantic cities!"
 KOL_idea_4: "Kölner Dom"
 KOL_idea_4_desc: "To be in Cologne and not to see the maginificent cathedral, is to be blind... as from every street, square, and building it can be seen dominating the city skyline. Housing innumerable treasures and relics,  including precious remnants of the Three Wise Men, it guarantees we will always stay true to only the Catholic faith."
 KOL_idea_5: "Rote Funken"
 KOL_idea_5_desc: "Regular troops of City of Cologne were called The Red Sparks for their astonishing red uniforms. Having an regular army in war-torn Empire is nearly a must, so we must cooperate with City to enchance our military performance."
 KOL_idea_6: "Wittelsbach archbishops"
 KOL_idea_6_desc: "The Wittelsbachs who couldn't count on inheriting any land from their fathers were destined to become Archbishops of Cologne. Ties with one of the grandest European dynasties make our state an important player on the continent."
 KOL_idea_7: "Eau de Cologne"
 KOL_idea_7_desc: "You can have a feast for the eyes in Cologne, watching the monumental cathedral; feast for the ears, hearing merry tunes of carnival; feast for the taste drinking Kolsch beer; feast for the touch admiring cloth in markets; and finally a feast for the smell through the aroma of Eau de Cologne, a one-of-a-kind perfume manufactured only here. Smell like an Archbishop, Archbishop. And don't drink it, despite the fact that it smells nice and is 80% alcohol. Kolsch is better and cheaper anyways."

 AVI_ideas_bonus: "Venaissin Ambitions"
 AVI_idea_1: "Sieges of Avignon"
 AVI_idea_1_desc: "The city of Avignon was sieged multiple times - first in antiquity, then the Dark Ages and the medieval period – as we are no mere village, but an important metropolis! We have learned what it means to be prepared for diseases, lack of food and water, and we will be always prepared to survive even years of siege. God helps those who help themselves..."
 AVI_idea_2: "Avignon Exhange"
 AVI_idea_2_desc: "We are prodigies in the modern-day economy: the new invention of foreign exchange markets was first established here in 1248. The Holy See used it to mantain numerable financial relations with European monarchs, but now we are free. If we retrict its use to our economic adversaries, we will quickly see their economy falter."
 AVI_idea_3: "Republic of Avignon"
 AVI_idea_3_desc: "Because of our economic importance, we once declared ourselves a republic. Short was her life: feudal lords quickly subdued us to their rule. But we never forget that small communes should have a degree of autonomy, for it makes them more willing to assimilate."
 AVI_idea_4: "University of Avignon"
 AVI_idea_4_desc: "Rejoice! A wild horde of drunkards, rascals, and easygoers can come to our city and study there! Nothing good will come of this, as every coin they pay us goes toward rebuilding what they have destroyed in their drunken rage. However, ages of dealing with students gave us experience at dealing with most unpleasant diplomats politely."
 AVI_idea_5: "Palais des Papes"
 AVI_idea_5_desc: "Lets face it: Avignon popes were not really rightful popes. Not truly independent, they marked the beggining of a schism tromenting the one true Catholic church. The Palace of Popes (and Antipopes) is a reminder of how they used to claim things that were not quite theirs. Who said it is not useful in politics?"
 AVI_idea_6: "Bridge of Avignon"
 AVI_idea_6_desc: "Legend has it the bridge in Avignon was built by Saint Benezet. When Jesus himself told him to create a passage across the Rhone, he formed The Bridge Brotherhood to help him in construction. Recreation of this Brotherood will enhance communication a lot."
 AVI_idea_7: "Great Schism"
 AVI_idea_7_desc: "We must remember the times when we were the seat of the spritual ruler of half of Europe: the Pope of Avignon was supported by kings of France, Scotland, Aragon and Castile. The time of Glory will come once more, hovever, not by the power of the Church, but by the power of our armies and subjects."

 Electoral_idea_1_desc: "We, the Electors of the Reich, hereby declare that is is only in our right to choose the Emperor, and neither Pope nor foreign kings shall influence our decisions. We shall thus form an alliance within ourselves, to ensure that we will not be forced to accept any dominion. Let Virgin Mary bless our men of state and Archbishops so that they will be always understood in good trust, even if their sinful minds have no good intentions."
 Electoral_idea_2: "Rhein trade"
 Electoral_idea_2_desc: "The Rhein is a vein for imperial trade, and our location combined with prerogatives of Electorial dignities give us trade possibilities second only to the Dutch. But trading might be not the best way to gain money as Prince-Archbishops. Nevermind, we can get indulgences. Pecunia non olet."
 Electoral_idea_3: "Privilege of Non-Appeal "
 Electoral_idea_3_desc: "We also decree that absolutely no subject of the Trier diocese can be summoned at the instance of any plaintiff beyond these same territories to any foreign tribunal. Check your privilege, Electors! Subjects of ours Serene Highnesses cannot appeal to any higher court, thus making us truly lords on our lands. It is right and just for us to deliver Salomonic jugdments, as we are the deputy of Christ on Earth... but the Emperor might revoke this privilege. Nah, there are several reforms before that, they won't make it."
 Electoral_idea_4: "Archchancellors of the Empire"
 Electoral_idea_4_desc: "Chancellors are vital for any state: they conduct diplomacy and deal with state affairs that require the skill of thinking about more than how to conceive an heir or hunt a deer. Thus, we are necessary for the Reich. If we are responsible for its administration and expansion (at least nominally) why not use our skills for personal domains too?"
 Electoral_idea_5: "Cursed Article 13"
 Electoral_idea_5_desc: "For such privileges and charters, if, and in as far as, they are considered to derogate in any way from the liberties, jurisdictions, rights, honors or dominions of the said Prince Electors, or any one of them, in so far we revoke them of certain knowledge and cancel them, and decree, from the plenitude of our Imperial power, that they shall be considered and held to be revoked. \nWe could be true masters in our own castles – if not for article 13 of the Golden Bull, a perilous paragraph that gives the current Emperor the ability to revoke our rights whenever he wishes. Let him come, we say. We shall be prepared."
 Electoral_idea_6: "Indulgence trade"
 Electoral_idea_6_desc: "Sobald der Gülden im Becken klingt, im huy die Seel im Himmel springt! \nHear ye, hear ye! Save your soul and find yourself a cozy place in Heaven by buying an indulgence! Have kids? Buy some for them! Someone died in your family? Buy one for him or her too! And don't listen to any crazy monk that tries to convince you this is the fruit of Papal avarice and greed, don't mind that it is not fully consistent with Catholic doctrine – just take one and your conscience will be peaced down after the slaughter of battle, pillage, and rape!"
 Electoral_idea_7: "Three Lord Inquisitors"
 Electoral_idea_7_desc: "It seems that more than a few people were unsatisfied with the indulgence policies we brought. Now we're in the middle of a religious war with our own people. Heretical perversion and deceit have no bounds. Thus we should establish inquisitorial bases in our capitals, and give those Papal Grand Inquisitors permissions as large as there have to be for them to fight, burn, and root out heresy from the lands of Prince-Archbishops. We will be paragons of Catholic piety in the Holy Roman Empire."

 FIU_idea_5: "Renaissance and Baroque"
 FIU_idea_5_desc: "From the XVI century onwards, our city was largely rebuilt in the new styles coming from Italy and Europe. If we invest in creating splendid palaces and gardens, our city will be the envy of all the Adriatic."

 SMX_idea_1_desc: "Hailing from the Illyrian island of Rab, Saint Marinus came to Italy around the turn of the fourth century to escape Emperor Diocletian's persecution. He eventually founded a monastery on the future site of San Marino in 301 AD, and upon his death he allegedly stated 'Relinquo vos liberos ab utroque homine' - freeing the city from both Pope and Emperor - but it wasn't until the kindly noble Felicissima that the citizens were truly independent."
 SMX_idea_2: "The Oldest Republic"
 SMX_idea_2_desc: "Since the ancient Greeks, republics have dotted Europe. Even great Rome was once a republic, freed from the tyranny of Tarquinius Superbus, until the treachery of Julius Caesar led it once again towards autocracy. But while these republics fell, San Marino has stood testament to Republican ideals for centuries on end. May it last to the end of time!"
 SMX_idea_3: "Establish Captains Regent"
 SMX_idea_3_desc: "In 1243 the Sammarinese republic moved from its old system, the 'Arengo' - a council of family leaders similar to the Roman senate - to a dual position of Capitani Reggenti, more like Roman consuls. Their terms only lasted for six months, and each was nominated from an opposing party, ensuring a balanced government free from the ambitions of those who wished to establish hereditary rule."
 SMX_idea_4: "Mountain Commune"
 SMX_idea_4_desc: "The nucleus of San Marino is centered upon Monte Titano, making it easily defensible. It was only until the deposition of Sigismondo Pandolfo in the 1400s that the republic expanded to include other cities, though a tradition of civil disobedience remained in the population. When Cardinal Giulio Alberoni occupied the republic and forced a new constitution upon it, the citizens refused to bow to his demands and soon won back their freedom."
 SMX_idea_5: "Statutes of 1600"
 SMX_idea_5_desc: "The Statutes of 1600 were the first documents pertaining to the administration of the Republic. Soon after, the Republic signed a treaty with the Papal States guaranteeing its protection and independence. Though strained by later developments, this treaty lasted to nearly the end of the Papal States' existence as a politican entity."
 SMX_idea_6: "Napoleonic Friendship"
 SMX_idea_6_desc: "Napoleon's conquest of Italy put San Marino in a precarious situation, needing to balance its allegiance to the Papal States with the threat of French aggression. Surprisingly, San Marino inspired a personal fondness in Napoleon himself, who recognized the state's freedom, exempted it from taxation, wrote in praise to his commissars, and even offered to annex more territory to it. Though the Sammarinese declined this offer, they maintained a shared dedication to Republicanism."
 SMX_idea_7: "The Last Microstate"
 SMX_idea_7_desc: "During Giuseppe Garibaldi's wars to unify Italy into a single Kingdom, San Marino gave refuge to many persecuted Unificationists, including Garibaldi himself. In return, Garibaldi exempted San Marino from the new Italian state when he eventually won out over the other peninsular powers. Thus San Marino was left as the only Italian microstate left in existence, surrounded completely by the Kingdom. The Principality of Monaco remained independent as well, but had been as much in the orbit of France as Italy historically."

 MER_idea_1: "Duchy of the Sea"
 MER_idea_1_desc: "The Slovenian name for Merania was 'Vojvodina Meranija', coming from the native word for 'sea' - 'morje'. Though its lands were later centered around inland Bavaria and Franconia, it started out on the Adriatic roughly corresponding to the territory of the former Istrian March and Carniola. Some chroniclers even assigned it the whole Dalmatian littoral, though this claim is dubious as the Kingdom of Croatia firmly held these lands until Venetian incursions."
 MER_idea_2: "Reichsunmittelbarkeit"
 MER_idea_2_desc: "Imperial Immediacy held a ruler of the Holy Roman Empire to be a complete sovereign in his own lands, answerable only to the Emperor himself. The status was closely linked to the title Imperial Prince, and while both eventually became quite common throughout the empire, Merania was one of the earlier polities to enjoy these prestigious accolades. The Dukes were thus considered part of the highest noble ranks."
 MER_idea_3: "Serbian Connections"
 MER_idea_3_desc: "Friedrich Barbarossa's abortive Crusade was launched by land through the Balkans, starting by traveling through Merania. He negotiated a marriage between the Meranian duke's daughter and Prince Toljen of Hum, a relative of the rulers of Serbia. It is unknown whether the planned marriage took place, but regardless, Merania maintained a geographical and political connection with the Serbs."
 MER_idea_4: "Expand into Croatia"
 MER_idea_4_desc: "Much of Merania's titular territory was purely theoretical, lying under the de facto control of Croatia and Hungary. The Dukes did not hesitate, however, to expand at the expense of these Slavic states, conquering such cities as Gottschee and Tschernembl, and thus establishing a border that would last for nearly a thousand years and counting. Though eventually ending up under Slovene sovereignty, these freshly conquered cities became integral outposts in the Germanic empire's frontier."
 MER_idea_5: "Meranian Fever"
 MER_idea_5_desc: "The control of ports on a busy inland sea exposes one to numerous plagues and diseases. Learning from Italian neighbors, the Meranian subjects demonstrate an adeptness at naval management and warfare. From quarantines to cannonfire, a master can be found in any Meranian port."
 MER_idea_6: "The House of Andechs"
 MER_idea_6_desc: "The decadent house of Andechs, originating in Southwestern Bavaria, was invested with the Duchy of Merania towards the end of the twelfth century to balance power versus the Wittelsbachs. Though separated by vast gaps, the Andechser dukes held the original Adriatic lands, their homelands, massive Franconian holdings, the rich Tirolian city of Innsbruck, and even the Palatinate of Burgundy on the opposite side of the Empire."
 MER_idea_7: "Episcopal Loyalty"
 MER_idea_7_desc: "When Pope and Emperor took arms against each other for the second time since the Investiture Controversy, under the rule of the Hohenstaufens, the Dukes of Merania decided to stay loyal to their nominal overlord, the Bishop of Bamberg. Though this earned Duke Otto an Imperial Ban and the confiscation of all territories, none could say Merania was unloyal to the true faith."

 SCY_idea_4_desc: "Around AD 945, Dyfnwal III fell in battle against the English. His sons escaped and managed to hide the Crown Jewels in Grisedale Tarn before their capture. We should recover them!"
 SCY_idea_5: "English Alliance"
 SCY_idea_5_desc: "In 1054 Edward the Confessor dispatched Earl Siward to attack the Scottish King Macbeth, in tandem with Malcolm of Strathclyde. Let us continue this tradition of cooperation."
 SCY_idea_6: "Build Carlisle Castle"
 SCY_idea_6_desc: "The English region of Cumbria, falling on the lands of Strathclyde beyond the Solway Firth, was dominated by Carlisle Castle from the late 11th century onwards. Raising this magnificent castle would continue the spirit of Hadrian's Wall and boost our border defense."
 SCY_idea_7: "Appanage Legacy"
 SCY_idea_7_desc: "It is ambiguous how much influence Alba exerted over our nation in the past, but eventually Strathclyde became a royal appanage. The glory of our title lived on throughout history - a testament to our ancient noble pedigree."

 ILE_idea_1_desc: "At the southwest end of Islay lies a peninsula called Na Roinn, known for the marked diversity of its biomes - wetlands, bogs, fractile rocks, fertile plains, dunes, and grasslands. Many animals live in the Rinns, and its agricultural output is impressive."
 ILE_idea_2: "Godred's Grave"
 ILE_idea_2_desc: "The great King of Sudreyjar, Godred Crovan, died of a pestilence on Islay. A standing stone near Carragh Bhan supposedly marks his eternal resting place, decorated with traditional Viking and Celtic art. Whether it really is Godred's tomb, the beautiful Ringerike patterns will forever decorate the island."
 ILE_idea_3: "Battle of Epiphany"
 ILE_idea_3_desc: "January 1156 saw a great battle between the Norse and the Norse-Gaels off the coast of Islay. Though it began on the night of Epiphany, it continued on throughout the next day until a stalemate. The people of Islay will always remember this engagement, and learn from the triumphs and failures of the many other fleets that have passed through our waters."
 ILE_idea_4: "Seat of the MacDomhnaills"
 ILE_idea_4_desc: "Domhnaill, grandson of Somerled, originally held Islay as a hereditary lordship within the family's greater Hebridean holdings. It was from this powerbase that the MacDomhnaill clan expanded their influence, eventually dominating the entire seaboard as one of the most powerful vassals of the Scottish crown."
 ILE_idea_5: "MacDubgall Forfeiture"
 ILE_idea_5_desc: "The rebellion of the MacDubgalls against Robert the Bruce caused their holdings and titles to be confiscated, and redistributed to the lords of Islay and of the Isles. This greatly expanded the sphere of influence of the island."
 ILE_idea_6: "Council of the Isles"
 ILE_idea_6_desc: "The advisors of the Lord of the Isles met at Eilean na Comhairle on Islay, occupying an ancient structure. One important document produced by the lord and advisors was the 1408 Islay Charter."
 ILE_idea_7: "Islay Whiskey"
 ILE_idea_7_desc: "The monarchs ruling Islay realized its potential for agriculture and moved to expand grain, oat, and barley farming across the island. One of the fruits of this endeavor was the creation of Islay Malt Whiskey, one of five main regional Whiskeys across the entirety of Scotland. The use of Peat in the brewing process gives the whiskey a smoky quality, attracting connoisseurs from across the world."

 AYL_idea_2: "Unite the Lordships"
 AYL_idea_2_desc: "The core lands of Argyll were originally divided between the lordships of Argyll Proper and of Lorne. In 1222, however, in recognition for royal assistance, Somerled's grandson Donnchad was invested with both titles, essentially uniting them."
 AYL_idea_3: "Dál Riata Heritage"
 AYL_idea_3_desc: "Argyll emerged as a political entity after the old Irish thalassocratic kingdom of Dál Riata was thrown into chaos, its mainland possessions being cleft from its islands. The Alban kingdom and numerous prominent dynasties claim descent from this ancient state, but our claim is one of the most legitimate."
 AYL_idea_4: "Diocese of Argyll"
 AYL_idea_4_desc: "Since the middle ages, Argyll was home to its own titular bishopric, seated at Saint Moluag's Cathedral in Lismore. Moluag is the patron saint of Argyll, adding on to the region's religious prestige."
 AYL_idea_5: "Kintyre"
 AYL_idea_5_desc: "Though it changed hands many times, the Kintyre peninsula is a jewel in the diadem of Argyll. From its famous Mull to its colorful history - such as the time a Norse king dragged his ships across it - Kintyre contributes to all facets of Argyllian strength and notability."
 AYL_idea_6: "Renovate Inveraray Castle"
 AYL_idea_6_desc: "The ruins of an older fortification were improved in 1743, establishing the basis of Inveraray Castle. Its Gothic architecture has stood as a foreboding reminder of Ducal power ever since - especially after the village was moved away from the castle just to give the occupants more space."
 AYL_idea_7: "Patrick MacKellar"

 FFE_idea_2: "Beware Macduff"
 FFE_idea_2_desc: "The descendants of Dubh, Mormaer of Fife, were known as Clan Macduff. One particular Mormaer is famous for joining the rebellion against King Macbeth of Alba, immortalized in Shakespeare's eponymous play. In the play, Macduff eventually kills Macbeth, fulfilling the warning - 'Macbeth! Macbeth! Macbeth! beware Macduff; Beware the thane of Fife. Dismiss me. Enough.'"
 FFE_idea_3: "Assume the Title Justiciar"
 FFE_idea_3_desc: "Many Fifian Earls simultaneously held the honorific title 'Justiciar of Scotia', the highest legal office within the kingdom. Responsibilities included supervising the realm's sheriffs and sergeants, holding court, and meeting with the King - while the privileges were innumerable."
 FFE_idea_4: "Capitalis Legis Clenmcduffe"
 FFE_idea_4_desc: "Our title is fundamentally linked to our dynasty, and in many cases the chief of Clan Duff led the men of Fife rather than the invested Mormaer. Our legitimacy will remain unquestioned."
 FFE_idea_5: "Battle of Falkirk"
 FFE_idea_5_desc: "Although the battle of Falkirk was a loss, the men of Fife were present defending Scotland from English machinations, and showed their courage on the battlefield. This Fifian bravery will go down in history."
 FFE_idea_6: "Princess Isabella"
 FFE_idea_6_desc: "Princess Isabella became the suo-jure countess of Fife upon the death of her father, and went through several high-profile marriages - all her spouses quickly dying. Let us learn from her Machiavellian diplomacy."
 FFE_idea_7: "Or a Lion Rampart Gules"
 FFE_idea_7_desc: "The only difference between the Coat of Arms of Scotland proper and of Fife is the royal addition of a flowery border. Some even theorize the royal arms are derived from Fife. Either way, the Fifian arms are a testament to its nobility."

 catducal_idea_1_desc: "The Spanish March was the first Carolingian bulwark against the Umayyad Caliphate. After drifting out of the French sphere of influence, several counties emerged from it - among them, ours. The tradition of frontier defense lives on in the Catalans, who will fight fiercely against heathen neighbors."
 catducal_idea_2: "Diocese of Urgell"
 catducal_idea_2_desc: "Urgell holds its own ecclesiastical diocese, one of the most ancient in Iberia. The state of Andorra was co-ruled by the Bishops of Urgell, and many members of the comital House of Urgell held the position over the centuries. In this way, the Catalan dynasties held power even beyond their political borders."
 catducal_idea_3: "Cerdanya Laws"
 catducal_idea_3_desc: "The county of Cerdanya descended from Wilfred the Hairy and the Bellonids. Even up to the second millenium, Cerdanya maintained the legal traditions of the Carolingian Franks - Salic Law - and that of the Visigoths who preceded them. A sophisticated judicial system consisted of both Judices and Boni Homines, who presided over trials."
 catducal_idea_4: "Fortifying the Counties"
 catducal_idea_4_desc: "Enemies surround us on all sides, from the Moors lodged around the Western Mediterranean to the French dukes across the Pyrenees and even other ambitious Spanish states who would like to expand their influence over our lands. We should improve our defenses and use the mountains to our advantage."
 catducal_idea_5: "Reunite the Pallars"
 catducal_idea_5_desc: "The County of Pallars was nestled in the valleys of the Pyrenees, ensuring its survival. In 1011, upon the death of Suñer I, the county was divided between his sons into two new states, Pallars Jussà and Pallars Sobirà. With its two administrative centers reunited, local defense and tax collection would be easier."
 catducal_idea_6: "Catalan Independence"
 catducal_idea_6_desc: "With the ascession of Hugh Capet in 987, the Catalan counties refused to pay homage to the new dynasty, fostering more of a connection with their fellow Iberian states in the form of Navarra and Aragon. Over the ensuing centuries, despite the expansion of the counts of Barcelona and the Aragonese kings, many smaller Catalan counties retained their independence. Even after they were absorbed, the Catalans sought free rule and special privileges."
 catducal_idea_7: "Pirineus Ironworking"
 catducal_idea_7_desc: "We are the pioneers of mountainside ironworking, trying out new methods and seeking ever greater efficiency. With proper ore smelting, the Catalan counties can support a well-equipped military to hold off our enemies. Diverting state funds to the effort is the best way to ensure our success."

 SKN_idea_1: "Øresund Ports"
 SKN_idea_1_desc: "The 'Ear-Sound' is first attested in Norse writing at the turn of the second millenium. The narrow waterway commands trade between the whole Baltic Sea and the rest of the world, making its control invaluable. Skane is centered upon some of its most important ports, such as Lund and Malmø. We should use this to our advantage."
 SKN_idea_2: "Harald Bluetooth's Conquests"
 SKN_idea_2_desc: "Originally, Skane was made up of five tribal units or Thanedoms, consisting of disorganized farmers. The first Danish king Haraldr united the region in the tenth century, overseeing its Chriastianization. Haraldr was the greatest of Scandinavian rulers, and a great asset to the true faith. Now that we have regained our indepdendence, we Skanians should model our society after his vision!"
 SKN_idea_3: "Skanian Law"
 SKN_idea_3_desc: "Encoded at the turn of the thirteenth century, Skanian Law is the oldest provincial law code in Denmark. Within the vernacular manuscript were laws regarding property, farming, fishing, criminal justice, marriage, heritage, common land, and more. We can further cement these laws by producing a Runic edition, a 'Codex Runicus', in this most ancient language of our fathers."
 SKN_idea_4: "Found the Lund Academy"
 SKN_idea_4_desc: "In 1425 a Franciscan monastery in Lund opened a university, dubbed 'the Academy'. Though it was eventually shut down in the wake of the reformation, it contributed greatly to the scholasticism of the region. In 1666, a spiritual successor was established in the form of the Regia Academia Caroline, which continued to educate Skania's citizens."
 SKN_idea_5: "Dominium Maris Baltici"
 SKN_idea_5_desc: "Establishing a Baltic Sea Dominion over the sea's entire coastland is the goal of all Scandinavian rulers. Due to its crucial position on the borderland between Denmark and Sweden, Skania has seen many battles on land and sea, and was endlessly fought over by foreign powers. Now that we have learned from these various attempted invasions, we can realize our own aspirations of dominance."
 SKN_idea_6: "Loyal Protestants"
 SKN_idea_6_desc: "Like most of Scandinavia, Skania abandoned the Church of Rome and decided to instead follow the teachings of Martin Luther. While continental Europe was rocked by endless pogroms and revolts, Skania was quite unified in its religious views."
 SKN_idea_7: "Resist Swedification"

 SZK_idea_1_desc: "Unio Trium Nationum was an alliance established in 1438 by the three Transylvanian Estates. The Hungarian nobility, the Saxon merchants, and the free military Szeklers. The union was a pact directed against the peasantry, many of whom were Romanian. This alliance would have a long lasting and unexpected impact on the history of our people."
 SZK_idea_2: "Guardians of the East"
 SZK_idea_2_desc: "The position of our lands on the easternmost border of the Carpathian mountains and across the Burzenland means the Székelys have been Hungary's frontier against the aggression of hordes and heathens. It was through these passes that the Mongols advanced in 1241, and we must ensure this never happens again."
 SZK_idea_3: "Comes Siculorum"
 SZK_idea_3_desc: "In the twelfth century the Szeklers of Transylvania were organized into a county, with its leaders appointed by the Hungarian king. This arrangement greatly benefited our people by turning us into an organized political entity, and the Kings of Hungary eventually adopted 'Count of the Szeklers' among their own titles."
 SZK_idea_4: "Cultural Melting Pot"
 SZK_idea_4_desc: "The origin of the Székely people has been long debated, but the commonly accepted explanation is that our ancestors were Magyars who mixed with Avars, Khazars, and Bolghars. Deftly handling multiple ethnicities and practices is part of our nation's ethos."
 SZK_idea_5: "Sun and Moon"
 SZK_idea_5_desc: "The icons of the Sun and Moon have been important to Magyars since the original conquest of the Carpathian basin. After the Christianization of the Kingdom, these symbols lost some of their significance, except for in Székelyland, where he have kept them alive."
 SZK_idea_6: "The Székely Seats"
 SZK_idea_6_desc: "Unlike feudal counties, Seats were unique administrative divisions in the kingdom of Hungary with extra autonomy and guaranteed rights. In return, military service was demanded. Thus the Seats are a boon to both our administrative efficiency and our fighting prowess."
 SZK_idea_7: "Beacon of Light"

 KLY_idea_2: "Guardians of the South"
 KLY_idea_2_desc: "Under the guidance of King Géza II the so-called 'Saxons' colonized southern Transylvania, closing off the passes used by Pechenegs and other hordes to raid the Carpathian basin. In tandem with the Teutonic Order in the Burzenland, we thus have a history of defending our homeland from foreign aggression."
 KLY_idea_3: "Diploma Andreanum"
 KLY_idea_3_desc: "The 1224 Golden Charter of the Transylvanian Saxons codified our rights and the land we would control as an autonomous entity. It was from this Royal document that we earned the name 'Royal Lands', or 'Királyföld' in Hungarian. We should reaffirm these rights given to us by András II, and seek a confirmation from the current Hungarian monarch that they will never be infringed."
 KLY_idea_4: "Restore the Kirchenburgen"
 KLY_idea_4_desc: "After the Mongols devestated our lands in the thirteenth century, our towns invested in fortified churches with massive walls. Many have fallen into disrepair over the centuries as we grew decadent under the demise of the Hordes' power. It would be foolish, however, to let a great preexisting defensive infrastructure go to waste, when there are still enemies stirring on all sides."
 KLY_idea_5: "Igrisch and Kerz"
 KLY_idea_5_desc: "We have shared a national religious identity since the earliest days of our colonization efforts, through such institutions as the 1191 Provostship of Hermannstadt. In later years, it was the Cistercian abbeys at Igrisch and Kerz which kept us united, and finally the wisdom of Johannes Honter, a Lutheran reformer who led the population in a mass conversion."
 KLY_idea_6: "The Saxon Seats"
 KLY_idea_6_desc: "Transylvanian Saxons were divided into Seats (special administrative divisions exempt from the usual comital feudal system by the King) with seven major towns - Schässburg, Mühlbach, Hermannstädt, Mediasch, Kronstadt, Klausenburg, and Bistritz. It was from these seven towns that we derived our name in many languages, such as German 'Siebenbürgen'. Administering our lands is thus quite easy compared to some states."
 KLY_idea_7: "Stephan Ludwig Roth"
 KLY_idea_7_desc: "Under a backdrop of revolutions and nationalism, Stephan Ludwig Roth allied with other factions of Transylvania in support of a union with the Romanian states. As a pastor and an intellectual, Roth was respected by his Saxon countrymen, but was ultimately assassinated by treacherous Hungarian radicals. We will not let his memory die - HIS NAME WAS STEPHAN ROTH!"

This all changed, however, in AD 983, when the Lutici and the Obotriti led a unilateral uprising against their foreign occupiers. Many Christian sites were plundered, and the Empire's controll beyond the Elbe collapsed completely."
 wendish_idea_2: "Danish Trade"
 wendish_idea_2_desc: "The Kingdom of Denmark is our greatest trade partner, with the Baltic Sea providing easy ship access to their southern islands. Lolland, Møn, and Falster are all littered with Wendish trading posts. Continuing this mercantile tradition is in our best interest, but some even engage in lucrative piracy."
 wendish_idea_3: "Restore Radegost"
 wendish_idea_3_desc: "It is known by various names - Rethra, Radagoszcz, Redigast... As the center of Slavic Pagan civilization, this great city and temple complex was a testament to Slavic power until the heathen crusaders destroyed it. Rebuilding must begin immediately if we are to survive as a cultural unit."
 wendish_idea_4: "The Confederations"
 wendish_idea_4_desc: "To resist foreign aggression, many Wends united together into great tribal confederations. The largest two were the Obotrites and the Liutizians, made up of such tribes as the Redarians, Tollensians, and Wagrians. This strategy of cooperation has served us well in the past, and improvements in infrastructure should allow us to take it to the next level of officiality."
 wendish_idea_5: "Wendish Crusade"
 wendish_idea_5_desc: "Our power was so threatening to the Germans that they launched a full scale Crusade against us in 1147. The greatest Kings, Dukes, and Bishops of the land needed to band together to make a dent in our defenses. Such is the bravery of our soldiers, and the resolve of our faithful!"
 wendish_idea_6: "Drvovid of the Rani"
 wendish_idea_6_desc: "The Rani, occupying the island of Rügen, were one of the most powerful Wendish tribes, and the only tribe to style their ruler as a King. Even more honored than the king, however, was the high oracle Priest, called the Drvovid. Such elevation of Church over State attests the sophistication of Wendish government structures."
 wendish_idea_7: "Ostsiedlung"

The rivers of Livonia are a crucial part of this route, leading from the Baltic to the Kievan Rus and eventually Byzantium. We can thus exact tolls on travelers and hold an important role in Eastern geopolitics."
 livonian_idea_2: "Amber Deposits"
 livonian_idea_2_desc: "Prehistoric geological processes resulted in the Pruthenian and Livonian coasts being rich with Amber, which was at times valued even more than Gold. By expanding our collection of coastal Amber deposits, we can turn Livonia into an ecnomic powerhouse through trade down the Amber Road."
 livonian_idea_3: "Principalities of Latgalia"
 livonian_idea_3_desc: "Among the southern Livonian tribes, the Latgalians were the most advanced, holding extensive connections with the Orthodox Rus of Polotsk. Organized Christian principalities like Koknese and Jersika emerged on Latgalian land, who could deftly negotiate with European crusaders to avoid the devestation of their territories and attain mutually beneficial deals. The Latgalians would go on to form the basis of Latvia itself as they assimilated their neighboring tribes."
 livonian_idea_4: "Vikings of Curonia"
 livonian_idea_4_desc: "The Curonians were a seafaring tribe, and were considered the most restless and wealthy of the tribes, amassing great riches through naval warfare and piracy. Many considered them Baltic Vikings, as their bravery on the sea was matched by their fierceness on land."
 livonian_idea_5: "Farmlands of Semigallia"
 livonian_idea_5_desc: "Between Latgalia and Curonia lay the twin lands of the Semigallians and Selonians, known for their verdant farms and productive farmers. Wanting to continue their way of life, they were extremely resistant to the incursions of the heathen Crusaders, leading resistance under such dukes as Viestards and Nameisis."
 livonian_idea_6: "Terra Mariana"
 livonian_idea_6_desc: "After the incursions of the German crusaders, Livonia was organized into the Terra Mariana, a confederation of Crusaders, Bishoprics, and vassal tribes. Thus, even after subjugation, the Livonians remained active in the governance of the region."
 livonian_idea_7: "Letten Vorzüglich in Liefland"
 livonian_idea_7_desc: "The Enlightenment held signficant sway in later Latvia, inspiring a Latvian nationalist movement. The Baltic German author Garlieb Merkel embodied the national sentiment in his book 'Die Letten Vorzüglich in Liefland am Ende des Philosophischen Jahrhunderts: Ein Beytrag zur Völker und Menschenkunde', which explained the oppression of the Latvian serfs under foreign rule.

The hill was decorated with wooden structures honoring different Baltic gods - Perkunas, Aušrine, Zemyna, Austeja, Ondenis, Patrimpas, Patulas, Velnias, Leda, Saula, and Menulis. Restoring this complex will be as much a boon to our naturalists as our cultural heritage."
 ZMG_idea_2: "Palemonid Legacy"
 ZMG_idea_2_desc: "The dukes of Samogitia, starting with Borkus, founder of Jurbarkas, claim descent from the legendary Roman Palemon. According to the legend, Palemon was a relative of Nero who escaped Rome with 500 families and traveled north to the Neman. The story is a myth, and was retroactively fixed to move Palemon's death into the 900s, but we don't need to let our neighbors know that."
 ZMG_idea_3: "Medininkai"
 ZMG_idea_3_desc: "Before it was known as Varniai, our Western capital was called Medininkai, established on the banks of the Varnele river. It became the seat of the Samogitian Bishops, and remained a cultural center with such distinguished residents as Mikalojus Daukša, the first man to publish in Lithuanian within the Commonwealth Duchy."
 ZMG_idea_4: "Victory Against the Orders"
 ZMG_idea_4_desc: "Samogitia, sandwiched between the Teutonic and Livonian Order, seemed ripe for conquest - however, when the armies entered they returned decisively defeated on several occassions by the skilled Samogitian armies. One defeat at Saule in 1236 was so severe for the Livonian Brothers of the Sword that they were forced to seek protection from the Teutonic Order, effectively ending their independence."
 ZMG_idea_5: "Rooted Pagan Beliefs"
 ZMG_idea_5_desc: "Samogitia was the last great bastion of Paganism before converting to Christianity in 1413. Some populations still even worshipped the old gods up until the 1560s. Resisting conversions from outside powers is necessary for the survival of our unique culture."
 ZMG_idea_6: "Changing Political Landscape"
 ZMG_idea_6_desc: "Samogitia changed hands several times between the crusading orders and the Grand Duchy of Lithuania, especially in the 14th and 15th centuries. However, they still kept their distinct autonomy during this period as Duke of Samogitia."
 ZMG_idea_7: "Lithuanian Cultural Revival"
 ZMG_idea_7_desc: "Despite its separation from Vilna, Samogitia was a focal point during the Lithuanian Cultural Revival, a reaction against oppressive Russian occupiers. Books in the Lithuanian language - which had been banned by the Russian Tsar - were smuggled throughout our region."

His actions, diplomatically, militarilly, and ecclesiastically, are prolific - we should all aspire to emulate him."
 MAF_idea_5: "Battle of Standard"
 MAF_idea_5_desc: "August 22nd, 1138 saw a great battle between David of Scotland and the Kingdom of England. David had invaded England at the head of a large army, and it was Galloway boys who were at the front of the first charge. Though the battle was a catastrophic failure, with nearly all of the Scottish army being wiped out, it proved the unwavering fearlessness of our troops."
 MAF_idea_6: "Castle Douglas"
 MAF_idea_6_desc: "The Douglases were invested with the Lordship of Galloway in the 1300s under Archibald the Grim. The Douglases improved Galloway's infrastructure, eventually building a familial castle from which to control the countryside.

 SVG_idea_2_desc: "In antiquity and the early Medieval era, Jutland was home to a staggering amount of tribes, and was the original homeland of several of the barbarians who would go on to divide Rome. While the Angles and Saxons departed for the British Isles, the Jutes and Frisians stayed behind, keeping Schleswig as a multiethnic region to the present."
 SVG_idea_3: "Restore the Danevirke"
 SVG_idea_3_desc: "Centuries ago, our ancestors built a series of fortifications along our southern border, to keep the Germans from overrunning our territory. Though it has fallen into disrepair, the surrounding geography still acts as a bottleneck against the continent, and it would be prudent to restore this ancient bulwark in light of the Treaty of Heiligen which established our border with Charlemagne and his successors."
 SVG_idea_4: "Ties to Holstein"
 SVG_idea_4_desc: "Under the rule of the Abel dynasty, the dukes of Schleswig fostered close connections with the Germans over the border in Holstein. With these friends in high places, we can exert more of an influence within the Holy Roman Empire."
 SVG_idea_5: "Establish Condominium"
 SVG_idea_5_desc: "Condominium refers to the holding of a territory by multiple simultaneous rulers. Schleswig experienced this under the house of Oldenburg, Haderslev, and Holstein-Gottorp, fracturing into many enclaved fiefs. While this may seem damaging, it also heightened Schleswig's defense as multiple powerful houses held stakes."
 SVG_idea_6: "Archdeaconry of Haderslev"
 SVG_idea_6_desc: "In the wake of the Protestant Reformation, an autonomous archdeaconry was created at Haderslev out of the former unified diocese of Schleswig. Along with Ribe, this archdeaconry used Danish for its services as opposed to the more ubiquitous German."
 SVG_idea_7: "Land Tenure Reforms"
 SVG_idea_7_desc: "A series of reforms across the 18th and 19th centuries gradually eroded the old systems of serfdom and forced labor, culminating with the tenure reforms of 1805. At last, peasants could own their own farms, entering into Schleswig's economy."
#Pruthenia

 PTH_ideas_start: "Pruthenian Traditions"
 PTH_ideas_bonus: "Pruthenian Ambitions"
 PTH_idea_1: "Early Mercenary Armies"
 PTH_idea_1_desc: "Pruthenia relied almost exclusively on mercenaries who often lacked discipline and loyalty. That has often been the core problem with mercenary forces, if you fight only for pay, you fight only so long as you think you'll get paid. A dead man can not pay you and you can not pay him."
 PTH_idea_2: "Frederican Professional Army"
 PTH_idea_2_desc: "Elector Frederick William developed the Prussian Army into a viable standing army, while King Frederick William I of Prussia dramatically increased its size and improved its doctrines."
 PTH_idea_3: "Pruthenian Tolerance"
 PTH_idea_3_desc: "The Pruthenian Monarchs were religiously tolerant and kept civil strife within their regions to a bare minimum. This gave Pruthenia an opportunity to start the recovery from the 30-years war earlier than most other players."
 PTH_idea_4: "Rise of Pruthenian Military"
 PTH_idea_4_desc: "Pruthenia started rising in its military power around these years, and has remained militaristic and strong for the rest of its years."
 PTH_idea_5: "Noble Officers"
 PTH_idea_5_desc: "Frederick William I restricted enrollment in the officer corps to Germans of noble descent and compelled the Junkers, the Prussian landed aristocracy, to serve in the army, Although initially reluctant about the army, the nobles eventually saw the officer corps as its natural profession."
 PTH_idea_6: "Promote Native Producers"
 PTH_idea_6_desc: "While Frederick William I wanted to have a mostly native-born army, Frederick II wanted to have a mostly foreign-born army, preferring to have native Prussians be taxpayers and producers."
 PTH_idea_7: "Modernizing Pruthenia"
 PTH_idea_7_desc: "The defeat of the disorganized army during Napoleonic wars shocked the Prussian establishment, which had largely felt invincible after the Frederician victories. While Stein and Hardenberg began modernizing the Prussian state, Scharnhorst began to reform the military. He led a Military Reorganization Committee, which included Gneisenau, Grolman, Boyen, and the civilians Stein and Könen. Clausewitz assisted with the reorganization as well. Dismayed by the populace's indifferent reaction to the 1806 defeats, the reformers wanted to cultivate patriotism within the country."

 MOR_ideas_bonus: "Moroccan Ambitions"
 MOR_idea_1: "Defenders of Al-Andalus"
 MOR_idea_1_desc: "As the most powerful state in Western Islam after the collapse of the Umayyads, it us up to us to defend Al-Andalus from the aggression of the Spanish Christians. Part of this will be consolidating our naval control and access to the Strait of Gibraltar, so we may easily move troops."
 MOR_idea_2: "Sagrajas"
 MOR_idea_2_desc: "The Battle of Sagrajas was our greatest triumph over the infidels and the key to our domination of Andalusia. It was said that the blood ran so think across the battlefield, our soldiers could barely keep their footing, earning the name az-Zallaqah - 'slippery ground'. With this glorious victory under our belts, we won't be losing our footing again."
 MOR_idea_3: "Berber Origins"
 MOR_idea_3_desc: "Native North-African Berber tribes have been the wellspring of several Moroccan dynasties. These Berbers are known for their resilience in the face of harsh desert conditions and long gaps between oases. It was the Gazzula Berber Ibn Yasin who formulated our foundational ideology of exported jihad against heathenry."
 MOR_idea_4: "Wings of Morocco"
 MOR_idea_4_desc: "The Moroccan military can be divided into two 'wings', like those of the later Golden Horde. While the horde was divided laterally, we are divided horizontally, into a South Wing based around Ghana and a North Wing based around Iberia. With such a system we can handle an empire with multiple vulnerable fronts."
 MOR_idea_5: "The Sunni Caliphate"
 MOR_idea_5_desc: "Many pretenders have adopted the title 'Kalifa' over the centuries, and still do to this day. The great Moroccan empire, with lands from inner Africa to northern Spain, is the true bearer of this coveted mantle. As Caliphs, we are the successors of Mohammed and the leaders of all the world's Muslims."
 MOR_idea_6: "Atlas Mountains"
 MOR_idea_6_desc: "Below the capital Marrakesh lies a series of steep mountain ranges known as the High Atlas and the Anti-Atlas. Like their namesake, these mountains hold our Moroccan world together, as a well-defended staging ground for Almohad conquests and a shield from southern attacks."
 MOR_idea_7: "Moroccan Coinage"
 MOR_idea_7_desc: "Minting coins in the name of the current monarch is one of the greatest methods of reinforcing his legitimacy, in addition to controlling the national economy. Powerful Almohad Caliphs like Abu Yaqub Yusuf issued gold coins covered in inscriptions of piety and dynastic nobility."
#Taifa

 taifa_ideas_bonus: "Taifa Ambitions"
 taifa_idea_1: "Umayyads"
 taifa_idea_1_desc: "After the death of Mohammed, a succession of new Caliphates emerged to lead the faith. First came the Rashiduns, winning great victories against the Romans, and next the Umayyads, who conquered Spain from its Visigothic lords. In the 750s, a treacherous revolt resulted in the Caliphate's exile to Iberia, called Al-Andalus - the land of the Vandals. The Umayyads ruled our lands until 1031, when their final collapse caused the Taifas to emerge. We must reclaim the Umayyad legacy and reunite the Andals!"
 taifa_idea_2: "Sevillan Diplomacy"
 taifa_idea_2_desc: "The men of Seville had the most success in rapid expansion at the expense of their neighbors, due to their adept diplomatic tricks and realpolitik. The Sevillans would hire mercenaries from Muslims and Christians alike, and play their enemies against each other, even allying with heathens."
 taifa_idea_3: "Muladi and Saqaliba"
 taifa_idea_3_desc: "Slavs may seem like the last group to turn up in an Andalusian Taifa, but they were actually a significant population in the Middle Ages. Brought over as slaves, these Saqaliba sometimes worked their way up to sovereign Taifa rule. In addition, large parts of our state populations are made up of mixed ethnicities - Berbers, Arabs, and converted Iberians living and working together."
 taifa_idea_4: "Islamic Scholarship"
 taifa_idea_4_desc: "It is not in the halls of Oxford or Milan that the greatest scientists and men of healing walk, but in the halls of Andalusian mosques. From mathematics to astronomy, from anatomy to botany, citizens of our Taifas are always at the cutting edge. Ibn Rushd, Ibn Zuhr, and Khalid ibn Yazid are just some of the towering scientific figures who lived amongst the Moors."
 taifa_idea_5: "Cast off the Parias"
 taifa_idea_5_desc: "As the northern Christian kingdoms became more powerful, they began to impose a tribute called a Paria on the weakened Taifas. It is time we asserted our independence and refused to pay any tribute to domineering neighbors."
 taifa_idea_6: "Andalusian Horses"
 taifa_idea_6_desc: "As early as 450 BC, Andalusian horses were known for their prowess in warfare. Over time, the Celts, Romans, Goths, and Moors developed them further, producing the elegant and hardy breed that exists today. With such noble steeds, the armies of heathenry will not stand a chance."
 taifa_idea_7: "Restore the Cities"
 taifa_idea_7_desc: "Cordoba, Toledo, Granada, Badajoz, Sevilla, Valencia, Zaragoza - each the center of a Taifa powerful in both political clout and cultural sophistication. We must decorate these cities with jeweled mosques and tapestries, promoting our distinctive Moorish architecture across the peninsula."
#South Slavic

 sslav_ideas_start: "South Slavic Traditions"
 sslav_ideas_bonus: "South Slavic Ambitions"
 sslav_idea_1: "Old Church Slavonic"
 sslav_idea_1_desc: "Old Church Slavonic was the first Slavic literary language, created with the help of the Byzantine missionaries Cyril and Methodius. It is from this Cyril that the Cyrillic alphabet emerged, and from whence its Greek connections come. It was primarily used for religious purposes, and helped foster our devout conversion from our old heathenish ways."
 sslav_idea_2: "Byzantine Raids"
 sslav_idea_2_desc: "For centuries, the Southern Slavs made a living off raiding the Romans across the Danube, taking advantage of the empire's perpetual distraction. These raids soon turned into large scale settlement, and by the seventh and eighth century the Byzantines had been pushed all the way back to only their largest and most impenetrable coastal cities."
 sslav_idea_3: "Autokefalna"
 sslav_idea_3_desc: "With the weaking of Greek Patriarchal authority, many self-governing churches sprang up across the Balkans. The Bosnians, for example, separated from both Rome and Constantinople, surviving multiple Crusades and attempts by Hungary to impose Catholic rule. We must join with our Slavic brethren and establish our own autocephalous church."
 sslav_idea_4: "Adriatic Trade"
 sslav_idea_4_desc: "The Adriatic Sea opened the Slavs up to lucrative trading opportunities with Latin Italy, especially the Republic of Venice. The Venetians captured many important coastal cities, but these incursions will only boost our economic power if we take proper advantage of them."
 sslav_idea_5: "Dušanov Zakonik"
 sslav_idea_5_desc: "Dusan's Code, crafted in the 1340s by Stefan Dušan the Great, codified the laws of the Serbian Empire and its successive Serbian Despotate. As an early example of a constitution, this legal codex stands as an inspiration to all Southern Slavs. We can adopt its principles for usage in our own state."
 sslav_idea_6: "Rum Millet"
 sslav_idea_6_desc: "Under the pressure of the Ottomans, hope was found in the establishment of the Millet system. The Ottomans permitted a degree of religious self-governance, with most of the Balkan Slavs falling under the Orthodox 'Rum Millet'. We can bolster our shared cultural identity over feast days and liturgy, as the Ottomans prefer Slavic Christianity to the grasp of Rome."
 sslav_idea_7: "Nationalism"
 sslav_idea_7_desc: "In the age of Revolutions and Enlightenment, the Balkan Peninsula, and specifically the Slavs, were a hotbed of ethno-nationalism. The Prussian statesman Otto von Bismarck predicted in the late 1800s that if a world war were to break it, it would be over something that happened in the Balkans."

 hunduc_idea_1: "Hercegség"
 hunduc_idea_1_desc: "Before the era of the oligarchs, there was nevertheless a precedent for Magyar ducal rule. An entity simply known as 'The Duchy', and consisting of scattered titles throughout the kingdom, was given in appanage to relatives of the Árpád monarchs until 1107."
 hunduc_idea_2: "Rule of the Oligarchs"
 hunduc_idea_2_desc: "Upon the fall of House Árpád in 1301, ambitious nobles from around Hungary achieved de-facto independence. This period of anarchy was known as the 'Rule of the Oligarchs', or 'Tartományúr'. We must usurp as many royal prerogatives as we can if we are to keep up with the other Oligarch's states!"
 hunduc_idea_3: "Magyar Tactics"
 hunduc_idea_3_desc: "We may be quite separated from those original Magyars who brought Dacia to its knees, but their military stratagems live on within us. One more time shall the Magyar cavalries ride across the plains of Eastern Europe, exacting tribute from our cowering neighbors."
 hunduc_idea_4: "Establish Banates"
 hunduc_idea_4_desc: "The Royal realm made extensive use of buffer states along the Carpathian mountains and Danubes, establishing various semi-independent polities under the rule of an appointed 'Ban', usually from a local noble family but sometimes from the core Magyar lands. We should implement this tactic in our own lands to hold the precarious borderlands."
 hunduc_idea_5: "Cuman Settlers"
 hunduc_idea_5_desc: "Over the centuries many steppe tribes occupied the Carpathian basin, from Avars to Khabars to our own Magyars. As the Cumans moved westward under the threat of Mongol invasion, they were offered organized settlement opportunities by the Hungarians. By letting them settle we will increase our fighting population."
 hunduc_idea_6: "Magyarországi Református Egyház"
 hunduc_idea_6_desc: "The Synod of Debrecen in 1567 issued a Helvetic Confession, seeding Calvinism throughout Hungary. Separated from Rome by the Ottoman Empire, and alienated by an aloof Austrian aristocracy, this adoption of Reformed faith reunited the drifting Magyar populations."
 hunduc_idea_7: "1848 Revolution"
 hunduc_idea_7_desc: "As the fire of revolution swept across Europe in 1848, Hungary was not spared, and the entire former Kingdom declared its independence from Austria. In this spirit of national pride and self-rule, we must be unwavering in the face of further foreign imperialists, like Lajos Kossuth and Artúr Görgei."

 walduc_ideas_bonus: "Wallachian Ducal Ambitions"
 walduc_idea_1: "We Were Romans"
 walduc_idea_1_desc: "In AD 106 Trajan conquered the Dacians and subsumed the trans-Danubian region into the Empire. Though the Romans later retreated, their Latin tongue has lived on amongst the Vlach peoples. It is from this direct line that Vlachs would later go on to take the name 'Romania'."
 walduc_idea_2: "Radu Negru"
 walduc_idea_2_desc: "Often connected with Basarab I, Radu Negru is the legendary founder of the Wallachian Principality at the turn of the fourteenth century, ending the dominance of the Hungarian Voivodes. We must aspire to unite Wallachia under one banner as Radu is said to have done."
 walduc_idea_3: "Battle of Posada"
 walduc_idea_3_desc: "The enormous Kingdom of Hungary attempted to subjugate the Wallachian people in the 1300s, sending 30,000 troops with King Charles at the head. A tiny force of cavalry and local peasants met the challenge, crushing the Hungarian army in a devestating ambush. This decisive victory engenders our national ethos."
 walduc_idea_4: "Order of the Dragon"
 walduc_idea_4_desc: "The Order of the Dragon was a noble organization founded by King Sigismund of Hungary, and modeled after the old Crusading orders. Many prominent Vlachs were members of the order, and it inspired the name of the house Draculesti. The Draculesti and Danesti voivodes would dominate Wallachia for centuries."
 walduc_idea_5: "Boyar Compromises"
 walduc_idea_5_desc: "Boyars are the Vlach nobility, and their interference in politics was a constant threat. By coming to a compromise with them, allowing certain rights and privileges, we can focus on internal stability. This model was used by Radu IV to great effect, making his principality the envy of the other Romanian states."
 walduc_idea_6: "Curtea de Arges Cathedral"
 walduc_idea_6_desc: "Dedicated to Saint Nicholas, this cathedral was inspired by Byzantine and Islamic architecture and remains an impressive icon of Wallachian Orthodoxy."
 walduc_idea_7: "Reorganize the Counties"
 walduc_idea_7_desc: "Wallachia has long been divided into major regions such as Oltenia and Muntenia. We should break down and redraw our administrative divisions to allow for a more smooth management of the Vlach lands and local minorities."

 marches_idea_1_desc: "Offa's Dyke was built by an Anglo-Saxon king of Mercia centuries ago. The earthworks now establish the border between Wales and England - the same border we have bravely ventured out over."
 marches_idea_2: "Appointed by England"
 marches_idea_2_desc: "The land conquered from the native Welsh petty kings has been organized into Earldoms, with each Earl invested by the King of England into a hereditary position. With the backing of the most powerful force in the British Isles, we too can dominate the political landscape of these strange Celtic lands."
 marches_idea_3: "Sicut Regale Rulers"
 marches_idea_3_desc: "Compared to normal English fiefs, we have extensive freedoms. Royal Writ does not apply in our frontier holdings, and we instead rule 'sicut regale' - 'ling a king'. We can build our own castles, administer laws, declare wars, establish Market Towns, maintain our own chanceries, confiscate lands, hold trials, and appoint our own sheriffs."
 marches_idea_4: "Roger Mortimer"
 marches_idea_4_desc: "Roger Mortimer was the most powerful of the Marcher Lords, holding exensive allodial titles across Wales and Ireland. He became so powerful, he effectively ruled England in tandem with his mistress Isabella - the wife of the English King Edward II. Eventually, Edward's son built up enough support to wrestle back control of his kingdom from Mortimer, and had him executed, sparing his mother's life. Ironic - he could save others from death, but not himself."
 marches_idea_5: "Foreign Settlers"
 marches_idea_5_desc: "It was not just the Anglo-Normans who conquered and settled South Wales. Many invested Earls were brought directly from mainland France, but also from Brittany and Flanders. Our lands are thus comprised of a coalition of foreign and domestic populations, each with their unique strengths they provide to the state."
 marches_idea_6: "Geoffrey of Monmouth"
 marches_idea_6_desc: "He who controls the past, controls the future. He who controls the present, controls the past. Geoffrey of Monmouth is the greatest of our Cambro-Norman historians, famous for his work on Arthurian legend. Historia Regum Britanniae remains the definitive work on the history of our realm."
 marches_idea_7: "Council of Wales"
 marches_idea_7_desc: "Edward IV needed to properly administer Wales even long after his eponymous ancestor's conquests. In 1472 he established the Council of Wales and the Marches, a regional governing body originally headed by important Bishops. Wales thus had a degree of internal governance far beyond its integration."
#Polish Ducal

 polduc_ideas_start: "Polish Ducal Traditions"
 polduc_ideas_bonus: "Polish Ducal Ambitions"
 polduc_idea_1: "Testament of Boleslaw Wrymouth"
 polduc_idea_1_desc: "The 1138 will of Boleslaw III, called 'Wrymouth' for his deformed jaw, divided the recently-strengthened Kingdom of Poland amongst his sons. It was from this division that all polish Duchies emerged, setting in motion centuries of internal conflicts and intrigues. We owe our existence to Boleslaw's vision."
 polduc_idea_2: "Ethnic Backgrounds"
 polduc_idea_2_desc: "Before the unification of Poland into one Christian state, there were Slavic tribal units in its present lands. The Silesians, Mazovians, Vistulans, Polans, and Pomeranians were the main powers, and they each live on now in the names of our duchies. Though the distinctions have blurred, we are essentially nominal ethnostates."
 polduc_idea_3: "The Seniorate"
 polduc_idea_3_desc: "Boleslaw's testament didn't just divide Poland - it decreed a system of hierarchy, with one province centered on Kraków known as the 'Seniorate', as it was always ruled by the oldest heir and had nominal suzerainty of the other states. To push our interests, we could perhaps bend these rules and find some claim to senior privileges ourselves."
 polduc_idea_4: "Ties With the Germans"
 polduc_idea_4_desc: "Poland's interaction with the German Holy Roman Empire was extensive, though obviously strongest in the east and south. The Silesian duchies entered into a vassal relationship with Bohemia, while the Pomeranians joined the Empire as well under the influence of Brandenburg. These ties mean our royal houses have extensively intermarried, and our trade relations are tight."
 polduc_idea_5: "Divide for Appanage"
 polduc_idea_5_desc: "After the original division of Poland, the sub-duchies were again divided into even smaller territories. Kujavia emerged from Mazovia, Greater Poland produced Kalisz, Gniezno, and various smaller states. In the end, the smaller dukes had less power projection but could more closely administer their lands."
 polduc_idea_6: "Magdeburg Law"
 polduc_idea_6_desc: "The Magdeburg Laws were perhaps the most important in medieval European administration, dealing with the autonomy and rights of individual cities. Under these laws, Poland was urbanized with more modern infrastructure and thousands of villages were founded. Even major pre-existing cities like Poznan benefited from the introduction of these laws."
 polduc_idea_7: "Janusz Mazowiecki"
 polduc_idea_7_desc: "Janusz III was the last of the Piast dukes to rule in Poland before being subsumed into the Royal realm. Despite his death, the duchy retained autonomy under its rebellious nobles under 1576, when it was fully integrated by the Jagiellons. We must ensure that our state maintains its own freedoms, and that ambitious Kings will not bend us to their will."

 EPI_idea_1: "Pyrrhos"
 EPI_idea_1_desc: "In the third century BC, a Molossian king called Pyrrhos ascended to the kingship of Epirus and led it to great victories. He made the Epirote state so strong it rivaled Rome itself, leading multiple attacks against this rival republic. He is remembered in the term 'Pyrrhic Victory', which denotes a win at great cost - the type of win Epirus will always be willing to achieve when necessary."
 EPI_idea_2: "Empire of the Angeloi"
 EPI_idea_2_desc: "When Constantinople fell in 1204, not all of the Byzantine Empire's lands were conquered by the Latins. The three main areas remaining under Greek control - Epirus, Nikaea, and Trebizond - each declared themselves the legitimate successors to the defunct state. It is only our Angelid 'Komnenos-Doukas' dynasty that has an actual legitimate claim, from Isaac in 1185 all the way up to the murdered Alexios Mourtzouphlos. We will avenge Mourtzouphlos and restore the Empire's rightful heirs!"
 EPI_idea_3: "The Second Noah"
 EPI_idea_3_desc: "Many displaced Greeks from around the Aegean have been welcomed to the benevolent realm of Epirus over the years. Our founder was even described as a 'Second Noah', taking in refugees from the Latin flood. Though Latins eventually held their own influence in Epirus, this open embracement of new citizens has remained."
 EPI_idea_4: "Arvanites"
 EPI_idea_4_desc: "Arvanites were a type of Hellenized Albanians who first lived around Himara and Argyrokastro before migrating to Thebes and Attica. Since the Serbian Empire, Albanians established their own states in the Epirote region, holding court at such cities as Arta. These Albanians were known for their ferocity, mercilessly attacking Greeks, Latins, and Turks alike."
 EPI_idea_5: "The Last Franks"
 EPI_idea_5_desc: "The port of Vonitsa was finally lost to the Turks in 1479 after decades of clinging on. With its fall, the last remnants of the Frankokratia established over 250 years earlier were finally erased, barring a handful of Venetian ports. We were first among Greeks, and last among Latins."
 EPI_idea_6: "Ionian Islands"
 EPI_idea_6_desc: "As the lords of the Ionian coast, we have extensive connections to the islands of Cephalonia, Zakynthos, and Kerkyra, and command trade between mainland Greece and southern Italy around the Strait of Otranto. The influence of Epirus over these islands was so great their Orsini lords converted to Orthodoxy and adopted Greek customs to appeal to us."
 EPI_idea_7: "Souliote Revolutions"
 EPI_idea_7_desc: "The Souliotes inspired some of the fiercest revolutions against Ottoman rule in Greek history, such as the 1685 Himaran revolt and the mid-1700s Ottoman subjugation attempts in which army after army were destroyed. Their 1770 Orlov revolt presaged the Greek War of Independence, and even after the nation had won its freedom, the Epirote people revolted one final time in 1854."

 WDX_idea_1: "The Peacock"
 WDX_idea_1_desc: "The Counts of Wied used the peacock as their coat of arms. Peacocks ar known for their beautiful plumage and symbolise pride and vanity. The name Wied comes from the nearby Wied river. The castle of the early Counts of Wied, Burg Altwied, had never been conquered. The Counts also were used to leading their troops, having fought in battles to protect the Empire."
 WDX_idea_2: "Keep Good Relations with the Palatinate"
 WDX_idea_2_desc: "The Counts of Wied had always had good relations with the Pfalzgraves, as they had long been fiefs, and even thereafter the Palatinate continued to support Wied. This lead to numerous advantages, like receiving Ledigmann as a vassal."
 WDX_idea_3: "Das Recht auf weitgehende Religionsfreiheit"
 WDX_idea_3_desc: "In order to attract more inhabitants to the slow-growing newly-founded city of Neuwied, the Count gave the city in a charter numerous freedoms, including the right to elect their Magistrate or to collect taxes, but most exceptionally for that time, the right to a broad religous freedom. Many people fled from other counties to Neuwied due to relgious intolerance. In the 18th century, seven different religious communities lived in Neuwied: Calvinists, Lutherans, Catholics, Mennonites, Inspirationalists, Herrnhuters and Jews."
 WDX_idea_4: "Wetzlarer Punctation"
 WDX_idea_4_desc: "At a certain moment there was a dispute about the municipal revenues between the Count and the Magistrate. Before the trial was finished, an acceptable compromise was made. In the Wetzlarer Punctation, not only were the financial disputes solved, but also the religious and other freedoms were reconfirmed."
 WDX_idea_5: "City of Schools"
 WDX_idea_5_desc: "The Counts of Wied recognized the value of education and encouraged education to the best of their ability. Already in 1616, an edict was issued, which ordened compulsory schooling in the County. Since then Wied has always been a very important center of education with it's numerous schools."
 WDX_idea_6: "Prince Maximilian of Wied-Neuwied"
 WDX_idea_6_desc: "Prince Alexander Philipp Maximilian zu Wied-Neuwied as an explorer, ethnologist and naturaliest. He explored southeast Brazil and the Great Plains. He is most important for his correct depictions and detailed descriptions, mainly about the Brazilian tribes. But he also collected a large number of specimens of flora and fauna, still preserved in a museum. Several plants and animals are named after him."
 WDX_idea_7: "An Early Industrialization"
 WDX_idea_7_desc: "The immigrants, persecuted in other places, brought in many new production goods and skills, giving Wied an economic prosperity and contributed to a comparatively early industrialization. The furniture and watches produced in Neuwied were higly demanded by other courts. But also steel was a very important export product: it was for example used to build the first German railroad."

 PAA_idea_1: "Sieben Künische Dörfen"
 PAA_idea_1_desc: "The villages of Wollaberg, Heindlschlag, Hintereben, Jandelsbrunn, Rosenberg, Aßberg and Grund, together with the area of Wilderranna, formed a large enclave and important foothold in the Austrian lands. The Bishops of Passau frequently founded new vallages, expanding their territory and influence. Much later, when most of the Passauer land was lost due to the fall of the Holy Roman Empire, the bishops only held some villages they once founded in Bohemia."
 PAA_idea_2: "Not Suitable for Large Armies"
 PAA_idea_2_desc: "Invading armies had difficulties camping in Passau, as the small territory was not rich in food resources, so the resources could easily get exhausted. And if the troops were badly provisioned, they would get hungry even before fall."
 PAA_idea_3: "Confluence of the Inn and the Danube"
 PAA_idea_3_desc: "Passau was located at the confluence of the Inn and the Danube, and because of that it was an important trade city, as it linked the German and Austrian trade. But also the Ilz river is very close, providing a link to the Bohemian lands."
 PAA_idea_4: "Salzfertiger"
 PAA_idea_4_desc: "When laws regulating the salt trade were drawn by Bishop Otto, he ruled that salt which was transported on the Inn had to be stored and offered for sale in Passau for at least three days and it went through several processing stations there which were in the hands of businessmen called Salzfertiger who ran the large warehouses for the salt storage. These merchants established a powerful monopoly against their competition from Bohemia and Austria. After the three days and the customs clearance, the salt could continue its way toward the north and east. Some salt which arrived from the Inn was transported from Passau on the water route upstream to Regensburg and downstream to Vienna."
 PAA_idea_5: "Wall-Pillar Churches"
 PAA_idea_5_desc: "These type of churches already existed, but were rarely used and often only for small churches or as parts of larger buildings. The crucial breakthrough in the creation of the wall-pillar church took place mainly in Passau, as they wanted to erect a lot more churches to impress their rival Salzburg. Wall-pillar churches allowed relatively large, wide areas to be build cheaply and quickly  from bricks or rumble."
 PAA_idea_6: "Frequent Visitations of Discipline"
 PAA_idea_6_desc: "More than in other bishoprics, Passau carried many visitations of discipline, life and morals."
 PAA_idea_7: "Reduction of the Old Diocese of Passau"
 PAA_idea_7_desc: "The Diocese of Passau is much older than the neighboring dioceses, as Passau can be considered as the successor of the ancient Roman diocese of Lorch. It was also on of the earliest states to gain princely powers.\n\nWe are, or to be more correct, were the largest diocese of the Holy Roman Empire, stretching even into Hungary, but the Pope, Austria Bavaria and all the other neighbors don't seem to care about us, and just took away much of our influence to create more dioceses like Vienna. We should solve this militarily."

 SLZ_idea_3: "Missionary Missions Give Territory"
 SLZ_idea_3_desc: "We should invest more in missionary missions, as we can possibly gain more territory that way, like during the missionary missions in the region between the Raba, Danube and Drava rivers. At the end of these missions, a dispute arose between us and Aquileia about the borders, and the Emperor fixed the issue in our advantage!"
 SLZ_idea_4: "Primas Germaniae"
 SLZ_idea_4_desc: "The Primas Germaniae is a title of honor for the msot important Roman Catholic bishop in the German Lands. Mainz was the firt to have this title. Many other also claimed the title, like we, however, they all lost the Primate dignity, leaving us alone to bear this title!"
 SLZ_idea_5: "Convert or Leave"
 SLZ_idea_5_desc: "Protestant tendencies revealed themselves vigorously in the Bishopric, supported and promoted by the Protestant members of the imperial estates. In imitation of the Corpus evangelicorum, the Lutherans of the Salzburg territory formed a league, binding themselves by oath and an outward rite of mutual sprinkling of salt. The Archbishop did all he could; he invited the Jesuits as missionaries, and engaged the help of the emperor. Later he enforced the Decree of the Religious Peace of Augsburg: recantation or emigration. In ten years about 30,000 persons left the territory and settled in East Prussia, or in Würtemberg or Hanoverian territory; a few emigrated to Georgia in North America."

These lax laws, together with the already large commercial importance, made of Salzburg an important center of second-hand trade. It remained unregulated for almost a whole existence of the Salzburger State."

The lion in the coat of arms probably refers to this past."
 DDD_idea_2: "Waldemarturm"
 DDD_idea_2_desc: "It is said that the Danish king Valdemar II and his son were captured and held as prisoners in a tower of the town of Dannenberg. This tower received the name of Waldemarturm because of that."
 DDD_idea_3: "The Jeetzel River"

 DDD_idea_4: "Sankt-Johannis-Kirche"
 DDD_idea_4_desc: "The Saint-John's church of Dannenberg is one of the few old buildings it has, dating from 1385, although it has been renovated many times. Just like nearly everyone converted to protestantism, this church became a protestant one."

 DDD_idea_7: "Sold, Recovered and Lost Again"
 DDD_idea_7_desc: "In the early 14th century, the Duke of Dannenberg sold it's County to Lüneburg, ending it's existence. In the middle of the 16th century however, some members of a sideline of the Dannenberg family managed to regain power over a slightly larger independant Dannenberg. But this line soon became extinct in the middle of the 17th century, endig it's existence again and going back to Lünebrug."

 DXS_idea_1_desc: "These two local saints were the founders of the Abbey of Disentis. Sigisbert was a wandering Frankish monk, and Placidus was the local landowner who supported Sigisbert. The ruler of Chur, distrusting the two, murdered Placidus to prevent a loss of land. It did not help: Disentis became independant and controlled a very large estate. It is also one of the oldest monasteries of Southern Germany and Switzerland."
 DXS_idea_2: "Quick Mountain Movement"
 DXS_idea_2_desc: "The troops of Disentis were able to surprise attacking enemies with their rapidity. Even though they were greatly outnumbered, Disentis was able to do remarkable damage."
 DXS_idea_3: "Trons"
 DXS_idea_3_desc: "Near the secluded village of Trons, somewhere in it's thick forests, the best and most hardy men of the surroundings assembled to talk about justice, the love for liberty and humanity. The Abbot favored them with advice and his authority."

 DXS_idea_6_desc: "In the tenth century, Disentis controlled the most important passage in a large area. However, the Gothard route was laid, and the a lot of the traders went through that route instead of going through Disentis. This marked the end of our prosperity. We should change that and let the trade again go through Disentis."
 DXS_idea_7: "Bibla da Cuera"
 DXS_idea_7_desc: "Disentis used it's printing press to spread Romansh spiritual litterature, and they also made the first Catholic Romansh Bible, the Bibla da Cuera. Disentis became the cultural center of the Catholic Romansh people."

It's the Archbishop of Mainz who calls the electors together for an election, who accepts the new Emperor and exercises control over the Reichstag archives. He was formally the most important member of the Reichstag."
 MAI_idea_2: "Primas Germaniae"
 MAI_idea_2_desc: "The Primas Germaniae was a historical title of honor for the most important Roman Catholic Bishop in the German lands. Many were unsuccessful in claiming the title, but after the Secularization in 1802, Salzburg was able to claim and hold it.\nInterestingly enough, this importance was also reflected in another title: in the Catholic world, there are only two Holy Sees: the Vatican Holy See and the Holy See of Mainz."
 MAI_idea_3: "Large Military Household"
 MAI_idea_3_desc: "The Archbishop of Mainz maintained one of the largest military households among the ecclesiastical magnates in Medieval Germany. For the Indiculus Loricatorum, a reinforcement consisting of heavy knights requested by Otto II for his campaign in Italy, Mainz gave one of the highest number of cavalrymen, even if they had already sent many. However, the military importance of the Mainzer army had severly declined in modern times."
 MAI_idea_4: "Old Roman Road Network"
 MAI_idea_4_desc: "Mainz lays at the confluence of the Rhine and the Main Rivers, two major transportation corridors, granting Mainz a position as major river port. Starting from the Roman times, Mainz was an important place regarding connections by road, having branches towards Trier and Metz.\nIn modern times, it held an even more important position, as it also controlled the roads between Madgeburg, Saxony, Hessen and Franconia, and thus secured the route from Pomerania into central Germany. It also connected many other cities, like Würzburg to Regensburg."
 MAI_idea_5: "Brand zu Mainz"
 MAI_idea_5_desc: "Mainz held an important position in Rheingau region, which is regarded as one of the best vineyard areas of the Empire, and much of this wine passed through Mainz. The town further also lays in a fertiel territory, and there was an extensive agricultural activity meant for export, like fruit, tobacco hemp, millet, but especially grain.\nHowever, Mainz, unlike Frankfurt, was less a commercial center but more a distribution center for goods.\nMainz had the right to oblige that all goods had to be unloaded and offered for sale for at least three days before being retransported. The Bishop secured the fees for them as receipts for the state fund. These were collected in the so-called Brand zu Mainz building."
 MAI_idea_6: "Mainz Diocesan Feud"
 MAI_idea_6_desc: "After a close election, the Archbishop of Mainz was not recognized by the Pope, who appointed his contender. This eventually became an armed conflict. This war had ravaged the Mainzer lands and caused the end of the existence of the Imperial City of Mainz. The Bishop appointed by the Pope had won the war."
 MAI_idea_7: "Absolute Electors and the Cathedral Chapter"
 MAI_idea_7_desc: "The Elector and the cathedral chapter were frequently trying to limit each other's power, causing a real dualism. In practice, the Elector had a slight upper hand, as many had to follow him to not lose their position, and thus people tended more to obey the Elector than the cathedral chapter.\nOn the other hand, the Elector and the cathedral chapter were mostly of the same social class, and thus of the same interest group. The Electors had a domestic interest in assigning as many relatives as possible in the chapter to stabilize the government, as one of them would have a high chance to become the next Elector.\nBut during the age of absolutism, the Electors, especially the enlightened ones, sought and managed to gain more power."

 TUB_idea_4: "In Debt to Monasteries"
 TUB_idea_4_desc: "The Counts Palatine of Tübingen founded many monasteries, the most notable being the abbeys of Bebenhausen and of Blaubeuren. But several factors contributed to an economic decline of the county, most importantly due to their extravagant donations to the monasteries they founded. To gain time to pay off his debts to Bebenhausen Abbey, the control of Böblingen and Calw were transferred to the abbey. An Imperial City, in a sign of gratitude, paid of his debts  and so he regained control. But other members of the family were also heavily indebted. Eventually the most important territories were or sold (like the city of Tübingen) or donated to Bebenhausen Abbey, ending the existence of the County."
 TUB_idea_5: "Under Württemberger Rule"
 TUB_idea_5_desc: "For centuries Tübingen had been under the rule of the Duchy of Württemberg. This had some side-effects, like converting early to Protestantism, being dragged into the many wars of the Duchy, or serving as military base."
 TUB_idea_6: "Ebenhard Karls University"
 TUB_idea_6_desc: "One of the most significant event in Tübingen's history is the founding of the Ebenhard Karls University by Duke Ebenhard of Württemberg in 1477, making it one of the oldest universities in Central Europe.

 MAG_idea_4_desc: "The archbishops of Magdeburg held the title of a Primas Germaniae since a papal bull from 986.

 MAG_idea_5: "Risen from Ruins"
 MAG_idea_5_desc: "Our land and city was completly devastated during the so called Magdeburg Wedding by our intolerant opponents. This coined the phrase Magdeburgisation for such a terror. But if we now gave up and dissuaded from the right path, they would ultimately win. Therefore, we will rebuild our city and land to even excell our former glory!"
 MAG_idea_6: "Magdeburg Hemispheres"
 MAG_idea_6_desc: "Since we have dissolved Magdeburg's Abbey of St. Augustine and made the latter's library publically accessible for our citizens, the pursuit of knowledge has become a goal of a lot of burghers. One example is Otto von Guericke who made an impressive experiment showing how air pressure works and giving another proof for the existence of vacua. To do so, he connected two airtight half spheres and evacuated the hollow space inbetween with a pump. Thereafter, eight horses on each side weren't able to pull apart the sphere; only after air flowed in again were the horses able to do so."
 MAG_idea_7: "Strongest Northern Fortress"

 STY_idea_2: "Military Frontier"
 STY_idea_2_desc: "The defense of our frontiers is a serious issue, not so much how to do it but how to pay for it.

Although, this excludes nobles, during the past and especially during wars, we charged and prosecuted even our noble enemies. Some may say this to be insane, but for us it represents our independence and juristic understanding that common nobles are not better than our free city. Both are represented through our sigil with the red castle, the Rothenburg, and the court arbor for our right to high justice."
 ROE_idea_2: "Landkauf"
 ROE_idea_2_desc: "During the reign of mayor Heinrich Toppler at the end of the 14th century, the territory of Rothenburg dramatically increased. This was achieved by systematically acquiring castles, forests and villages from impoverished nobles whose downfall sometimes was even orchestrated by the city council. Although this lead to the formation of a coalition, the council of Rothenburg was able to secure the gained land, but thereafter new acquisitions had to be restrained. However decades after these events, the moment is at hand to continue with Rothenburg's expansion!"
 ROE_idea_3: "Rothenburger Landhege"
 ROE_idea_3_desc: "After our huge land acquisitions, we have to protect them from looting and from our enemies. Therefore, we will construct moats and walls, plant impenetrable hedges and let them maintained by experts called Hegemeister. Although, these defensive lines can not hinder big armadas from entering our lands, they still impede those and give us enough time to arm and mobilize our armies."
 ROE_idea_4: "Circle of Franconia"
 ROE_idea_4_desc: "We have to learn from the disastrous coalition which formed after the land acquisitions during Toppler's time, and prevent our neighbours from joining a war against us and instead play them out against each other. The Circle of Franconia is after the one of Swabia the most fragmented circle in the empire and consists out of clerical rulers, free cities and secular rulers . Therefore, it is of highest importance to establish and maintain good relations to our neighbours."
 ROE_idea_5: "Meistertrunk"
 ROE_idea_5_desc: "According to a legend, when after combat the general of the Catholic League, Tilly, was able to breach our citiy's walls on the 30th of October, 1631, Tilly wanted to execute four highranking city council members for Rothenburg's resistance. However during the wait for the executioner, vine served in gigantic steins of over 3 litres of volume was given to Tilly and his soldiers. Impressed by the size of the steins, Tilly made a joking comment that he would pardon the council members if one of them was able to empty the one of the steins in one gulp. As the former mayor Nusch was able to do so, Tilly fullled his joking promise and pardoned the city."
 ROE_idea_6: "Vine Land of the Tauber Valley"
 ROE_idea_6_desc: "The lovely Tauber valley and Rothenburg are the southern part of the Franconian vineyards. As we now control large parts of these, we can now compete with the vineyards around the river Main and so we are an equal trade partner. Therefore, both regions will prot from trading, and we might be even able to secure the privilege to bottle our vine into Bocksbeutel, a remarkable and famous ellipsoid bottle."
 ROE_idea_7: "Schneeballen"
 ROE_idea_7_desc: "Our bakers have created small ball like pastry called Schneeballen, because they look like snowballs. They are made out of short pastry through cutting the dough in small slices and twirling it around with a spoon. Thereafter they are boiled in fat and then powdered with sugar. Now already for years, they are eaten during festivals like Christmas and weddings and have become an integral part of our traditions."

 MCO_ideas_bonus: "Monegasque Ambitions"
 MCO_idea_1: "Rock of Monaco"
 MCO_idea_1_desc: "The Rock of Monaco is in many ways the basis of our state. A megalithic 203-foot promontory, it is easy to defend from both land and sea invasions, and has been prized since ancient Greek colonists first brought civilization to the area. Francesco Grimaldi's devious capture of the Rock in 1297 by disguising himself as a monk paved the way for the foundation of the Monegasque lordship."
 MCO_idea_2: "English Plunder"
 MCO_idea_2_desc: "During the Hundred Years' War conflict between England and France, the rulers of Monaco participated on the side of their continental overlord. During the English Channel naval campaign of 1338, Monaco helped sack Southampton and brought many English riches back to the capital."
 MCO_idea_3: "Monégasque Dialect"
 MCO_idea_3_desc: "Though it falls within the Ligurian family of Italian languages, Monégasque also has French influences, and is known to be quite similar to the Niçard dialect to its west. The language of our people thus bridges the gap between different cultures, and attests to our position at the crossroads of empires."
 MCO_idea_4: "Palazzo dei Principi"
 MCO_idea_4_desc: "To increase the prestige of our state, Lord Honoré II sought the elevation of Monaco to a Principality, a privileged rank afforded to few rulers in Europe. He renovated the Rock by constructing the Princely Palace, complete with robust defenses, a chapel, pool, mirror gallery, and priceless artwork like Murano chandeliers and Jan Brueghel paintings. With a Princely title, Kingship is almost within our grasp!"
 MCO_idea_5: "Treaty of Péronne"
 MCO_idea_5_desc: "The deft political maneuvering of Prince Honoré II also led to Monaco securing its independence not only from domineering Spain but also from the more immediately threatening France. The treaty was signed on September 14th, 1641, and added a level of de-jure nationhood onto our already de-facto sovereign status."
 MCO_idea_6: "Risorgimento"
 MCO_idea_6_desc: "Italian Unification had a profound affect on Monaco. Several cities, such as Menton and Roquebrune, revolted against the Prince in an attempt to federate with the rest of Italy. Though they were ultimately annexed to France in the Treaty of 1861, Monte Carlo and Monaco itself were reconfirmed in their sovereign independent status. Like San Marino, we escaped the fate that befell virtually every other Italian city."
 MCO_idea_7: "Casino de Monte-Carlo"
 MCO_idea_7_desc: "Incorporating a casino in our largest community under a puppet company - le Société des bains de mer de Monaco - will funnel profits straight to the ruling family. Sumptuous and expertly planned, the casino is the brainchild of Princess Caroline and will attract some of the richest figures in Europe to our small state. Never forget, the house always wins."

 SIE_idea_1: "Remember Montaperti!"
 SIE_idea_1_desc: "During the Guelph-Ghibelline conflict, neighboring Florence was our arch-rival. In September of 1260, tensions came to a head and a battle was fought - the bloodiest in medieval Italy. With the help of a German ambush party we routed the Florentines despite having half as many troops, killing thousands of them and capturing the rest. To this day, the Sienese cry 'remember Montaperti!' at sporting events."
 SIE_idea_2: "Studium Senese"
 SIE_idea_2_desc: "The University of Siena was founded in the middle of the thirteenth century, making it one of the oldest in Europe, and the first to be publicly funded. Due to generous grants from Pope Innocent IV and successive Podestàs, it became a prosperous center of learning, teaching Latin, Logic, Law, and Medicine."
 SIE_idea_3: "Bancaria"
 SIE_idea_3_desc: "Siena's riches in the middle ages were often tied to its banks. From 1287 to 1355 the city was directly ruled by prominent banker families, a period which came to be called the 'Noveschi'. Under this mercantile guidance, the city reached the apex of its power and stability."
 SIE_idea_4: "Dieci, Undici, Dodici"
 SIE_idea_4_desc: "Before and after the Noveschi period, the citizenry of Siena organized the city into a council of nobles, though these proved to be short-lived and were continually replaced by different groups. First came the ventiquattro (twenty-four), then the trentasei (thirty-six), the quindici (fifteen), the dodici (twelve), the dieci (ten), and the undici (eleven). Siena is used to rapidly adapting to new circumstances of government."
 SIE_idea_5: "Piazza del Campo"
 SIE_idea_5_desc: "The Piazza del Campo is the jewel of our city, known for being one of the most beautiful public spaces in Europe. In 1419 Jacopo della Quercia added the Fonte Gaia (fountain of the world), decorated with a Madonna and representation of classical virtues, which entertains the many citizens who congregate in the piazza for commerce and celebratory events such as the bi-annual Palio di Siena horse race."
 SIE_idea_6: "Pandolfo Petrucci"
 SIE_idea_6_desc: "As with many Italian city-states, Siena was home to strongmen who attempted to rule as tyrants. One of these was Pandolfo Petrucci, who in the fifteenth century managed to seize total control of the Republic and became a 'benevolent dictator'. Petrucci strengthened the declining state and spurred a renaissance of arts and science. Though Petrucci's sons squandered his hard-fought advances, his legacy lives with the city."
 SIE_idea_7: "Government in Exile"
 SIE_idea_7_desc: "When the treacherous Spaniards and Florentines finally conquered the Sienese Republic, 700 important families continued to resist the invaders as a rump-state exiled in Montalcino. They held out for several years before the overwhelming enemy forces finally crushed them, a testament to the morale of the Sienese people."

 FER_idea_1_desc: "The traditional lands of Ferrara were originally swamps and lagoons created by the Po river delta. Though the lagoons were eventually reclaimed, the natural salt pans surrounding them were a source of wealth for the inhabitants of our state for centuries."
 FER_idea_2: "Casa d'Este"
 FER_idea_2_desc: "In 1146 the death of Guglielmo Adelardi caused Ferrara to come into the possession of the lords of Este, who were, in fact, a cadet branch of the famous Welf dynasty - namesakes of the Guelphs. These prestigious origins are reflected in the fortunes of our ruling family, who came to inherit Modena and Reggio."
 FER_idea_3: "Papal Fief"
 FER_idea_3_desc: "Though Ferrara was first created a Duchy by the Holy Roman Emperor, in 1471 it was also reconfirmed in its ancient status as a Papal Fief by Pope Paul II. The then-ruler, Borso, agreed to pay yearly tribute to the Pope and recognize him as his liege lord in return for the recognition of his Ducal status."
 FER_idea_4: "Ercole d'Este"
 FER_idea_4_desc: "The greatest of the Ferraran Dukes was undoubtedly Ercole I, who ruled from 1471 to 1505. Nicknamed 'The Diamond' and 'North Wind', he was a consistent supporter of the arts and culture. Ferrara became one of the most attractive cities in Europe for aspiring painters, composers, writers, and architects, forging connections with Flemish painters and figures like Biagio Rossetti and Antoine Brumel."
 FER_idea_5: "Concerto delle Donne"
 FER_idea_5_desc: "Translating to 'consort of ladies', this group of virtuosa singers consisted of Laura Peverara, Anna Guarini, and Livia d'arco. They continued the innovative artistic tradition started by Ercole, and were significant in improving the standing of female singers in general."
 FER_idea_6: "Renovation"
 FER_idea_6_desc: "Later in its history, Ferrara was rocked by a series of earthquakes which leveled half the city and destroyed many of the most important buildings. The constant aftershocks were so severe they resulted in a phenomenon known as 'soil liquefaction'. With all this damage, we must attempt to restore the glory of Ferrara, and fund a new earthquake observatory to prevent a disaster like this from striking again in the future."
 FER_idea_7: "Castel Tedaldo"
 FER_idea_7_desc: "At the southwest corner of Ferrara lay an ancient castle known as Tedaldo. In the 1600s, it was improved by the Papacy, and remained the most significant bastion of the region until its dismantling by the newborn Kingdom of Italy in 1859. Even in its destruction, it continued to serve Ferrara as the bricks were used in various new constructions."

 MFA_idea_1_desc: "Otto I, nominal founder of the Holy Roman Empire, reorganized Northern Italy into a series of fiefs including 'Western Liguria'. Western Liguria was granted to its former overlord Aleramo, a son-in-law of the Italian King Berengar II d'Ivrea. This prestigious scion is the founder and namesake of our dynasty."
 MFA_idea_2: "Crusader Kings"
 MFA_idea_2_desc: "The descendants of Marquess Rainiero became involved in the crusades, most significantly under Bonifacio I in 1204. After crushing the Byzantine Empire, he became King of the newly-created Kingdom of Thessalonica, under the sovereignty of the Latin Emperor of Constantinople. His descendants in turn would hold the royal title until the Kingdom's collapse in 1224."
 MFA_idea_3: "Byzantine Connection"
 MFA_idea_3_desc: "Our forays into crusading were not the only nor the most notable connection we forged with Byzantium. After the fall of the Aleramici dynasty, the Greek Palaiologoi took over the margravial title. We should use these diplomatic ties to our advantage, especially in the event of Byzantium's demise. The rulers of Montferrat could very well be rightful Byzantine Emperors!"
 MFA_idea_4: "Sacro Monte di Crea"
 MFA_idea_4_desc: "Around the fourth century AD Saint Eusebius of Vercelli installed a statue of the Virgin in a remote sanctuary. In 1589 a new, more robust sanctuary was built around the original, complete with frescos and an arboretum called the Parco Naturale del Sacro Monte."
 MFA_idea_5: "Unite the Montferrino Lands"
 MFA_idea_5_desc: "For centuries Montferrat was divided between two power centers, respectively formed around the capital Casale Monferrato and around Canelli. We must consolidate our lands around the pesky city of Asti and forge a direct land connection between the two divided portions of the realm, facilitating movement and defense alike."
 MFA_idea_6: "Anti-Austrian Bulwark"
 MFA_idea_6_desc: "During the Risorgimento, Casale Monferrato was an important defensive emplacement against the hostile Austrian Empire. The Austrians laid siege to the city in 1849 and were driven off by its defenders, and a few years later its defenses were improved even further. We must maintain its fortified status to ensure the French, Spanish, and Germans never occupy our lands."
 MFA_idea_7: "Industrialism"
 MFA_idea_7_desc: "Montferrat must adapt to changing times by becoming an industrial center. The presence of Portland Cement in the hills surrounding Casale Monferrato makes it ideal for the burgeoning cement industry; we must capitalize on this opportunity for national profit."

 URB_idea_1_desc: "The Eastern region of the Papal States is known as the Marches, due to the presence of the ancient triple march of Ancona, Camerino, and Fermo. In the middle ages it continually fragmented, producing our Urbinate state as the most powerful successor. We hold the keys to transapennine Italy - all who wish to pass must bow to our will."
 URB_idea_2: "Mons Feretrius"
 URB_idea_2_desc: "Mons Feretrius is a strategically important rock formation home to the Forte di San Leo. It was coveted by the Eastern Roman Empire, the Lombard Kingdom of italy, and the German princes, until finally it came under control of the future rulers of Urbino - the eponymous Montefeltro dynasty."
 URB_idea_3: "Condottieri"
 URB_idea_3_desc: "Italy's military legacy is embodied in the condottieri, professional soldiers who worked for the highest bidder and often amassed great wealth and power. Of these already legendary figures, Duke Federico III of Urbino was one of the most vaunted. Federico was a true Renaissance Man, as his military genius came with a remarkable intelligence and tact for leading."
 URB_idea_4: "Palazzo Ducale"
 URB_idea_4_desc: "Building a Ducal Palace for Urbino would signal the prestige and power of the royal family. Prolific architects Luciano Laurana and Donato Bramante have offered to design this glorious living space, where we may fill the 'scriptorium' with Urbino's priceless collection of books and manuscripts."
 URB_idea_5: "Legazione"
 URB_idea_5_desc: "Apostolic Legates were in charge of governing the scattered lands of the Papacy on behalf of the Holy Father. Urbino is important enough to warrant the appointment of a legate, bringing us into more direct communion with the Holy See."
 URB_idea_6: "Count Cagliostro"
 URB_idea_6_desc: "Alessandro di Cagliostro was a self-styled 'magician' and adventurer whose repertoire of scams included alchemy and holistic medicine. Having incurred the wrath of the Papacy and the Inquisition for his actions, he was betrayed to the Pope and imprisoned for being a charlatan - right here in Urbino. It was in the dungeon of San Leo that he ultimately died, and his occult reputation lives with the lands."
 URB_idea_7: "Restore the Duomo"

 NIC_idea_2: "River Paillon"
 NIC_idea_2_desc: "Repeated attacks by the Saracens led to the construction of considerable defenses around Nice. The River Paillon gives a natural defensive boost to the landward side of our city, working like a moat to prevent besieging armies from being able to approach the medieval walls."
 NIC_idea_3: "Promote Italian"
 NIC_idea_3_desc: "Since the Roman conquest of Nice, Latin has been used by the elite class for administrative matters. In 1561 the Duke of Savoy, Emanuele Filiberto, decided to abolish the use of Latin in favor of the local Italian dialect, creating a more transparent and uniquely Italic government."
 NIC_idea_4: "Liberoscambismo"
 NIC_idea_4_desc: "We should open the ports of Nice to all nations, proclaiming an edict of complete free trade. By coaxing the local noble families into joining this mercantile enterprise, our economy will be stronger than ever."
 NIC_idea_5: "The New Town"
 NIC_idea_5_desc: "After 1713, when the Treaty of Utrecht was signed, Nice was firmly re-attached to Savoy and a period of peace followed. In this time, work began on the costruction of a 'New Town', fit with all the trappings of a sleek, contemporary Enlightenment city."
 NIC_idea_6: "Garibaldi's Birthplace"
 NIC_idea_6_desc: "Giuseppe Garibaldi is one of the most important figures in the history of Italy, standing alongside the likes of Julius Caesar and Theoderic. His nationalist campaign of 'Risorgimento' led to the unification of the peninsula under one flag for the first time in centuries, and he himself was a native of Nice. Giuseppe was always fond of his birthplace and opposed its annexation by France."
 NIC_idea_7: "Between Two Worlds"
 NIC_idea_7_desc: "For a long time, Nice has sat at the crossroads of France and Italy, poised just beneath the end of the Alps between the Comte de Provence and the Ducato di Savoia.

 LUC_idea_6: "Exile of Dante"
 LUC_idea_6_desc: "While Dante Alighieri was born in Florence, their aristocracy was not very tolerant of his later works, and so he was exiled. During his exile, signor Alighieri resided within Lucca for the longest of time, and we are proud to host a Poet such as him."
 LUC_idea_7: "Libertas!"

In its early days, Florence relied upon the Wool guild for the majority of textile production, but with time production also included Silk. Much of these textiles were coloured with dyes from the Orient, but some, like Purple, were pioneered here in Florence."
 LAN_idea_2: "The Florin"
 LAN_idea_2_desc: "The 54 grain Florin has been the Gold Standard of European banking since 1252, and is the first coin since the Byzantine solidus to fill this role. The Fiorino d'oro or Gold Florin, spread by Florentine banks, is accepted almost universally and gives our Republic near endless opportunities for commerce."
 LAN_idea_3: "Birthplace of the Renaissance"
 LAN_idea_3_desc: "The writings of Dante Alighieri and Petrarch in the 14th century brought forward a resurgence in interest and rebirth in long-lost Classical thought: the Renaissance. Florence is the home of many of the Renaissance's most influential figures, and certainly all of Europe can thank us for that."
 LAN_idea_4: "Banco Medici"
 LAN_idea_4_desc: "The Medici bank was founded in 1396 by Giovanni d'Medici and for decades held hegemony over Europe. The bank funded operations of Artists and Nobility alike across the continent, and given its' unprecedented size, several new administrative innovations were devised, including the Leger and Double-Entry systems."
 LAN_idea_5: "Machiavellian Secularism"
 LAN_idea_5_desc: "'Religions are man-made, but integral to the functioning of a society', so were the words of Machiavelli. Born in Florence, Niccolò Machiavelli and his Philosophical writings brought countless new concepts to us, from aspects of Humanism, to a understanding of Religion."
 LAN_idea_6: "Cattedrale di Santa Maria del Fiore"
 LAN_idea_6_desc: "Cattedrale di Santa Maria del Fiore: 'Cathedral of Saint Mary of the Flower', is the symbol of the grandeur of Firenze and our symbol to show Rome the religious devotion of Florence and its' people. It stands tall amongst the skyline of our Comune, and projects over the region much like the influence our noble Republic."

 ORA_idea_2: "Orange University"
 ORA_idea_2_desc: "Many European cities hold their university as a point of pride, from Bologna to Oxford to Warsaw. Orange University has a particular significance in that it was founded by the Holy Roman Emperor Karl IV himself when visiting Arles to be crowned King of Burgundy in 1365."

 ORA_idea_4_desc: "By far the most famous contribution of Orange is its provision of the royal dynasty of the Netherlands. In 1544 William the Silent of Nassau, who would go on to be a Dutch ruler, inherited Orange and took its name, founding the illustrious house of Orange-Nassau, or 'van Oranje'. This house would even rule the Kingdom of England."
 ORA_idea_5: "Huguenot Stronghold"
 ORA_idea_5_desc: "Because of our connection with the Netherlands, Orange became a hotbed for Reformed Christian activity, holding out against the massive surrounding French royal domain and its Catholicism. Though the Huguenots were eventually suppressed, their spirit lives on."
 ORA_idea_6: "Théâtre Antique d'Orange"
 ORA_idea_6_desc: "In ancient times, Orange was a Roman colony known as Arausio, or Colonia Julia Firma Secundanorum Arausio. As such, it was fitted with a Roman-style theater, which still stands to this day as one of Europe's greatest."
 ORA_idea_7: "Cadastre d'Orange"
 ORA_idea_7_desc: "One of the best preserved Roman maps ever discovered, the Cadastre dates from the reign of Vespasian and covers the land surrounding Orange. This marvelous artifact will attract many visitors to our city!"
#Loon
 LOO_ideas: "Loony Ideas"
 LOO_ideas_start: "Loony Traditions"
 LOO_ideas_bonus: "Loony Ambitions"
 LOO_idea_1: "Hasbania"
 LOO_idea_1_desc: "Hasbania, also known in other languages as Haspinga, Hesbaye, and Haspengouw, refers to the hilly geographical region at the border between the French and Germanic cultural areas in Belgium. Loon is perched within this region, straddling the two worlds."
 LOO_idea_2: "Reginar and Balderik"
 LOO_idea_2_desc: "In the era of prehistory, Loon was not a contiguous entity but rather a mess of personal holdings, constantly splitting and morphing. This changed in the eleventh century when the present county was founded by two households both alike in dignity: the house of Reginar and the house of Balderik. Both stretch back to the Carolingian era."
 LOO_idea_3: "Liègeoise Connections"
 LOO_idea_3_desc: "From its foundation, Loon was tied up with the Prince-Bishopric of Liège, sharing a dynasty with some of its most prolific bishops and indeed standing as a nominal vassal. We can exploit these connections to showcase our piety."
 LOO_idea_4: "Averbode Abbey"
 LOO_idea_4_desc: "With modest origins, Averbode came to be one of the most significant abbacies in the region, holding 5500 hectares of land and training countless clerics and monks. It had been founded in 1134 by Arnold, a count of Loon, and its position at the county's border testified to this generous endowment."
 LOO_idea_5: "Invest in Hasselt"
 LOO_idea_5_desc: "Loon's ancient capital was the eponymous city of Loon or Looz, while Hasselt stood as a close second within the county's confines. As Hasselt continued to grow, however, it became the new administrative center for the state, and would even rival Maastricht in its regional governance."
 LOO_idea_6: "Common Loon"
 LOO_idea_6_desc: "Gavia Immer, also known as the Common Loon, populates lakes and waterways across the Old and New worlds. It is universally beloved for its noble nature, haunting call, and striking black-and-white plumage. Though the etymology comes from unrelated Germanic words, we should be proud to share a name with this bird."
 LOO_idea_7: "Belgian Nationalism"
 LOO_idea_7_desc: "In the nineteenth century, the Lowlands were fractured between the Kingdom of the Netherlands and the newly-formed Kingdom of Belgium, a Catholic state of Flemings, Walloons, and other minor ethnic groups. Loon was fiercely dedicated to the Belgian side, and the local administrative region was actually split to allow Loon to remain within Belgium."
#Piombino
 POB_ideas: "Piombinesi Ideas"
 POB_ideas_start: "Piombinesi Traditions"
 POB_ideas_bonus: "Piombinesi Ambitions"
 POB_idea_1: "Guarnito d'Appiano"
 POB_idea_1_desc: "The earliest ancestor of Piombino's royal family was Guarnito d'Appiano, who appeared as a notary in the Republic of Pisa in the early thirteenth century. The family he started was endlessly ambitious, first rising up the ranks of notary guilds, then attaining governmental positions within Pisa, and finally becoming leaders of the Republic."
 POB_idea_2: "Etruscan Origins"
 POB_idea_2_desc: "Many cities across the Western world boast of their Roman origins. Piombino, on the other hand, has a pedigree reaching back before the Romans themselves to the Etruscan civilization. The area was known to the Etruscans as Populonia, and was one of their most important ports."
 POB_idea_3: "Elba"
 POB_idea_3_desc: "The jewel in the crown of Piombino is the island of Elba, which has been coveted since the Hellenistic era. The island's capital earned the name Portoferraio due to its rich metal deposits, and the island's defenses were so respected that it was chosen as the prison-house for Napoleon upon his first defeat."
 POB_idea_4: "Fortify Against Piracy"
 POB_idea_4_desc: "Though one does not think of the Barbary Coast as falling near Tuscany, Barbary pirates nevertheless devestated Elba, Piombino, and nearby surroundings with their raids. We must fortify against these raging infidels with coastal fortresses - construcy the Torre Mozza and redouble the strength of our city walls!"
 POB_idea_5: "Thalassocratic State"
 POB_idea_5_desc: "Holding territories only on the immediate coast and on islands, Piombino is the ideal thalassocratic state. Our sailors are well-trained, and our navies have an edge over the inland city-states occupying the rest of Tuscany."
 POB_idea_6: "Lucca e Piombino"
 POB_idea_6_desc: "At the time of Napoleon, our state was merged with Lucca to form a new principality. The significance of this action cannot be understated - thousands of sovereign polities met their end with Napoleon and his mediatisation, but Piombino was significant enough to continue on in joint rule, under Napoleon's sister Elisa no less."
 POB_idea_7: "Piombinesi Industry"
 POB_idea_7_desc: "The hinterland around Piombino is ripe for industrial exploitation. Let factory farms rise in the fertile fields, and where they cannot, let great coal processing factories spew out smoke until all the fields are in shadow, and the farmers can farm in the shade!"
#Ventimiglia
 VMG_ideas: "Ventimiglian Ideas"
 VMG_ideas_start: "Ventimiglian Traditions"
 VMG_ideas_bonus: "Ventimiglian Ambitions"
 VMG_idea_1: "Sovereign Diocese"
 VMG_idea_1_desc: "Ventimiglia has the privilege of not only being a commune and a city but also the seat of its own Bishopric, the Roman Catholic Diocese of Ventimiglia. This is not a recent creation, but rather has stood since the seventh century when a Bishop Giovanni is recorded."
 VMG_idea_2: "Lascaris di Ventimiglia"
 VMG_idea_2_desc: "In 1261 the reigning count of Ventimiglia, Guglielmo Pietro I, married the daughter of the Laskarid Emperor of Byzantium. From then on, all counts of Ventimiglia have been cognatic descendants of this legendary Byzantine dynasty. Like the Palaiologoi of Montferrat, Roman blood runs through our veins."
 VMG_idea_3: "San Michele Arcangelo"
 VMG_idea_3_desc: "In the tenth century, the counts of Ventimiglia converted a Pagan temple to a Christian church, dedicating it to Saint Michael. Now the Benedictines inhabit it, and it would reflect well on us if we funded its restoration in the newer Romanesque style."
 VMG_idea_4: "Invest in Tenda"
 VMG_idea_4_desc: "After Ventimiglia was lost to Provence, the brothers Guglielmo Pietro and Pietro Balbo moved the administative center of the state to the inland city of Tenda, which had been a lordship under the pre-Lascarid rulers. Though Ventimiglia remained the official name, many knew the state as 'the County of Tenda', nestled in a more easily defensible alpine position."
 VMG_idea_5: "Angevin-Savoyard Diplomacy"
 VMG_idea_5_desc: "Ventimiglia became something akin to a buffer state between the Angevin county of Provence and the extensive Duchy of Savoy in its later centuries. The Counts thus had to play each side against each other, sometimes acknowledging the rule of one, and sometimes the other."
 VMG_idea_6: "Col de Tende"
 VMG_idea_6_desc: "Separating the Maritime Alps and the Ligurian Alps, the Col de Tende is a high mountain pass between Italy and France. Its roots are as ancient as the region's Hellenistic colonies, and we should use it to our advantage, exacting tolls for its continued maintenance."
 VMG_idea_7: "Last French Conquest"
 VMG_idea_7_desc: "Over the centuries France carved out much land that had been traditionally aligned with Italy, including an exchange that saw the original Savoyard lands themselves lost to the house of Savoy. Tenda, the later capital of our county, was the last Italian commune to ever join the French Republic."
