#elective
 elective_monarchy.1.t: "Nobility Supports $HEIR$ $HEIR_DYNASTY$"
 elective_monarchy.1.d: "The Nobility stood united today in their support for $HEIR$ $HEIR_DYNASTY$, who despite $HEIR_ADJ$ foreign roots is viewed as a worthy successor to the throne of $COUNTRY$. This will strengthen his chance to assume power, should our current $MONARCHTITLE$ pass away."
 elective_monarchy.2.t: "Nobility Opposes $HEIR$ $HEIR_DYNASTY$"
 elective_monarchy.2.d: "A powerful faction within the Nobility has made clear their displeasure and dislike for $HEIR$ $HEIR_DYNASTY$, whom they view as a foreigner that has no understanding of the country $HEIR_S_PRONOUN$ wishes to rule. Their campaign has weakened $HEIR_ADJ$ chance to assume power, should our current $MONARCHTITLE$ pass away."
 elective_monarchy.3.t: "Bribing the Nobility"
 elective_monarchy.4.d: "A certain faction within the Nobility have made no secret of their dislike for $HEIR$ $HEIR_DYNASTY$, and now your spymaster has uncovered that they are plotting the assassination of $HEIR_ADJ$. If they are allowed to make the attempt, there is a considerable risk that we will be blamed, but arresting them would upset their friends in the Nobility. How should we proceed?"
 elective_monarchy.10.t: "Nobility Forces Abdication"
 elective_monarchy.10.d: "[Root.Monarch.GetName] knows that [Root.Monarch.GetHerHis] time may soon come. Wishing to secure the title for [Root.Monarch.GetHerHis] dynasty, [Root.Monarch.GetSheHe] has begun to seek support for selecting one of [Root.Monarch.GetHerHis] progeny as next in line, questioning the choice of the Nobility. The nobles have not taken kindly to this and are considering forcing the [Root.Monarch.GetTitle] to abdicate in favor of the heir they have already chosen for the throne."
 elective_monarchy.14.d: "Electing monarchs from different nations allows us, to some extent, to avoid a dynasty taking control over [Root.GetName] entirely, but also causes foreign nobles to sometimes doubt our loyalty. The [Root.Monarch.Dynasty.GetName] family to which our current [Root.Monarch.GetTitle] belongs has noticed that the increased support in the Nobility for [Root.Heir.GetName] of the [Root.Heir.Dynasty.GetName] dynasty. Although they hopefully understand that they can't rule our nation forever, they are beginning to ask questions about how this will affect future cooperation between us."
 elective_monarchy.14.a: "Assure them that the Nobility stays loyal to the [Root.Monarch.Dynasty.GetName] line."
 elective_monarchy.13.d: "Being of [Root.Culture.GetName] birth, [Root.Owner.Monarch.GetName] often visits [Root.GetName]. Not only does the province serve as a reminder to the [Root.Owner.Monarch.GetTitle] of [Root.Owner.Monarch.GetHerHis] past, but the people there who normally feel somewhat estranged from their [Root.Owner.GetAdjective] rulers are glad to see that that Nobility approved a monarch who speaks their language. A recent visit has considerably improved the locals' impression of the administration."
 elective_monarchy.14.c: "Stay neutral. The Nobility owes allegiance only to [Root.GetName]."
 elective_monarchy.15.t: "[From.GetAdjective] Nobility Shifts Allegiance"
 elective_monarchy.15.d: "After a noble of the [Root.Monarch.Dynasty.GetName] family ascended to the [From.GetAdjective] throne, we were hoping to see a long-time rule there by our dynasty. However, the Nobility's support of another foreign heir has strained the relationship between our nations. When pressured, [From.GetName] has made it clear that the times are changing, and that they are trying to avoid another monarch from [Root.GetName]."
 elective_monarchy.16.t: "[From.GetAdjective] Nobility Turns to Us"
 elective_monarchy.16.d: "[From.GetName] has been under pressure from the [From.Monarch.Dynasty.GetName] to maintain the bloodline's hold of their throne, but the Nobility has spoken against them, in our favor. [From.Heir.GetName], already having popular support in the Nobility, is now considered their primary candidate for escaping the dynasty's grip and avoiding an absolutist monarch."
 elective_monarchy.17.d: "Ruling in [Root.GetName] is not like ruling in other nations. Dictating the nation's goals is difficult without approval from nobles, sometimes impossible. To a foreign monarch, this may seem disappointing and frustrating, but this cornerstone of [Root.GetAdjective] politics is highly valued in its homeland and is, in fact, what [Root.Monarch.GetName] has to thank for coming into power in the first place. Embracing these ideas might make the [Root.Monarch.GetTitle] seem weak internationally, but would aid in integrating better and gaining supporters in the Nobility."
