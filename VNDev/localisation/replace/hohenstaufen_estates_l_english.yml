 tribal_estate_events.6.t: "Our Kingdom is in disarray!"
 tribal_estate_events.6.d: "Keeping vassals loyal is never an easy task and right now we are living through some dire times. The $ESTATE_NOMADIC_TRIBES$ could very likely help us stabilize the situation so that we can get back on our feet but we would be increasing their influence over our state."
 EST_VAL_TRIBES_STABILIY_BOOSTED: "Stabilized the Kingdom: §Y$VAL$%§!"
 tribal_estate_events.7.t: "Tribes view the Kingdom as weak!"
 tribal_estate_events.7.d: "Our military leadership is inexperienced and weak. The $ESTATE_NOMADIC_TRIBES$ are questioning if they can really support such green men in battle, offering instead to supply us with seasoned warriors ready to lead our troops."
 tribal_estate_events.7.b: "That worked oh so well for Rome."
 tribal_estate_events.8.t: "The Kingdom is not unified!"
 tribal_estate_events.8.d: "Our [Root.Monarch.GetTitle] has proven [Root.Monarch.GetHerselfHimself] unable to keep the [Root.GetAdjective] realm unified and the $ESTATE_NOMADIC_TRIBES$ worry that we are becoming the object of ridicule. Prominent clan leaders have approached the [Root.Monarch.GetTitle] offering to strengthen our rule though some would say that relying on others to enforce this unity makes for an unstable peace."
 EST_VAL_TRIBES_UNITY: "Kingdom Unified: §Y$VAL$%§!"
 tribal_estate_events.9.t: "Adopt Tribal Methods!"
 tribal_estate_events.9.d: "One of the Clan Chiefs has come forward, as a spokesman for their group, and urges us to model our state after their old warrior societies, using the tactics that made them strong. 'Crush your enemies, drive them before you, and hear the lamentations of their women!'"
 tribal_estate_events.9.b: "That is barbarianism!"
 tribal_estate_events.11.t: "[Root.Monarch.GetTitle] after the [Root.Monarch.GetTitle]"
 tribal_estate_events.11.d: "A distant cousin of [Root.Monarch.GetName] has managed to gain the gratitude of the tribes. Many strong tribal leaders are now demanding that we change the future plans of succession to ensure that this cousin is guaranteed his rightful place as [Root.Monarch.GetTitle]. Whether they are motivated by true loyalty to our kinsman or feel he could easily be influenced is hard to tell but they would certainly not take refusal to follow their advice very well."
 tribal_estate_events.12.t: "Tribes demand more men"
 tribal_estate_events.12.d: "Prominent Tribal leaders have approached us demanding that we let them make use of the state resources to defend their lands. They claim that neighboring states are making incursions and raids into the land they control and that the only efficient way to defend our borders is to put some of our troops directly under their command."

 cossack_estate_events.1.t: "Population of the Bailiwicks"
 cossack_estate_events.1.d: "The $ESTATE_NOBLES$ complain that an increasing number of peasants are deserting the safe homes provided to them to seek their fortune among the $ESTATE_COSSACKS$. They feel we are to blame as we have allowed the $ESTATE_COSSACKS$ to grow too powerful which is inspiring the peasants to abandon their rightful masters.\nRepresentatives of the major families now demand that we limit the power of the $ESTATE_COSSACKS$ so that they can expand their latifundia in the regions bordering the Knights' Bailiwicks. This way, they argue, the fields can be tilled and the laws of the realm upheld."
 cossack_estate_events.1.a: "These Peasants must be brought back."
 cossack_estate_events.2.t: "Holy Aggression"
 cossack_estate_events.2.d: "Moving quickly on foot or on horseback the Holy Orders are very adept inquisitors. Several such religious pogroms have lately laid waste to our countryside and even villages some way from our borders. Once a religious inquisition has been executed these vigilante knights retreat back behind the borders of our neighboring states as quickly as they came. Both the $ESTATE_NOBLES$ and our $ESTATE_BURGHERS$ have interests in the affected areas and both groups now demand that we do something."
 cossack_estate_events.2.a: "Demand that these dogmatic Holy Orders be brought to Justice!"
 cossack_estate_events.3.t: "Holy Aggression"
 cossack_estate_events.3.d: "Moving quickly on foot or on horseback the $ESTATE_COSSACKS$ are very adept inquisitors. Several such religious pogroms have lately laid waste to the [From.GetAdjective] countryside and even villages some way from our borders.\nAs the $ESTATE_COSSACKS$ responsible are based inside our borders the [From.GetAdjective] have now demanded both compensation and for the culprits to be brought to justice."
 cossack_estate_events.4.d: "The [From.GetAdjective] response is that they refuse to take responsibility for the heretic inquisitions into our country, claiming that they are unable to control the $ESTATE_COSSACKS$ themselves as the jurisdiction lies with the Papacy."
 cossack_estate_events.5.d: "The [From.GetAdjective] response has been to send some monetary compensation for the furor caused by their Holy Order subjects which has made up for the damage to property. They also claim that they have brought the guilty parties to justice."
 cossack_estate_events.6.d: "While few would dispute their influence on the Bailiwicks the $ESTATE_COSSACKS$ have many things working against them when it comes to gaining influence in the halls of power. The $ESTATE_NOBLES$ despise them and would see them all brought to work as peasants on their latifundia and their manners have not brought them many friends in [Root.Capital.GetCapitalName].\nLately however things have been going their way. They have managed to defend their baronies and their services to the state as troops and administrators are undisputable."
 cossack_estate_events.7.d: "The free nature of the $ESTATE_COSSACKS$ and the distance between them and the halls of power in [Root.Capital.GetCapitalName] has always been a problem for them. Due to their ascetic lifestyle the number of Knights registered with the state as officers with the benefits that entail have been decreasing steadily."
 cossack_estate_events.8.d: "Not all $ESTATE_COSSACKS$ are awarded the same privileges by the state. Traditionally rights are awarded to specific $ESTATE_COSSACKS$ that are willing to perform great services to the state in times of war. As these rights are not transferrable upon death this means that the influence of the $ESTATE_COSSACKS$ can vary greatly over time. According to the $ESTATE_COSSACKS$ it is high time we grant them further privileges to bolster our numbers."
 cossack_estate_events.8.a: "We need more enlisted Knights!"
 cossack_estate_events.8.b: "Let them tend to their Bailiwicks."
 cossack_estate_events.9.d: "Life in a city can be harsh as frequent war and fires ravage the land. While the $ESTATE_COSSACKS$ are used to fighting their own battles a little help from the central treasury could probably be put to good use. Last season was unusually harsh and together with an increasing number of mercenary incursions many $ESTATE_COSSACKS$ now have an urgent shortage of food for the coming months. If we were to supply the $ESTATE_COSSACKS$ with grain as well as military supplies such as arms and uniforms we would not only be strengthening our defenders directly we would likely also tie them closer to our state."
 cossack_estate_events.10.d: "There has always been tension between the $ESTATE_COSSACKS$ and the other estates, if nothing else because of their diverse backgrounds. Lately however these have increased considerably. The $ESTATE_BURGHERS$ are alarmed at the $ESTATE_COSSACKS$ privileges and claim that they are targeting shipments of their grain with fraudulent fees. The $ESTATE_COSSACKS$ themselves claim that they are only enforcing crown law and that the $ESTATE_BURGHERS$ are simply mistaken. As there is little in the way of centralized government representation in the area it is difficult to ascertain the truth but there is clearly friction between these two groups and we are expected to either reprimand or sanction one side in this conflict."
 cossack_estate_events.12.d: "The distrust of the $ESTATE_COSSACKS$ for the state in general and our [Root.Monarch.GetTitle] in particular has culminated in a total breakdown of authority in the Bailiwicks. The communities of the $ESTATE_COSSACKS$ are openly hostile to our emissaries and de facto now act entirely independent from central authority."
 cossack_estate_events.13.t: "Holy Order Expansion"
 cossack_estate_events.13.d: "Borders can often be theoretical things, especially in the wild fiefs of the Middle Ages. It seems the $ESTATE_COSSACKS$ have expanded their influence rapidly into an area that previously wasn't under their control. We could attempt to reverse this development but the $ESTATE_COSSACKS$ would likely not take kindly to being removed from land they have worked hard to develop and fortify."
 cossack_estate_events.14.d: "The old dream of the $ESTATE_COSSACKS$ has always been to be accepted as the equals to the long-established local estates such as the $ESTATE_NOBLES$ or $ESTATE_BURGHERS$. Never has this dream been closer to realization than now. The $ESTATE_COSSACKS$ have achieved great influence in our state and in many ways we rely on their support.\nGiven the favorable circumstances many $ESTATE_COSSACKS$ are now voicing their old demands for official recognition and privileges."
 cossack_estate_events.15.t: "[Root.GetName] Holy Orders Revolt"
 cossack_estate_events.15.d: "Unimpressed by our decree to vacate [Root.GetName] the Holy Orders there have risen in revolt."
 cossack_estate_events.16.d: "Good relations need to be maintained. As their numbers grow and some of the leaders of the $ESTATE_COSSACKS$ grow older our warm relations have grown colder. We need to make arrangements with the current generation of $ESTATE_COSSACKS$ leaders in order to be sure of their loyalty."
 estate_disasters.10.t: "The $ESTATE_COSSACKS$ Break Free"
 estate_disasters.10.d: "$MONARCH$ has allowed the $ESTATE_COSSACKS$ of $COUNTRY$ to grow too powerful and now they have made their move. Their great influence over local baronies as well as over many matters in [Root.Owner.Capital.GetCapitalName] has allowed them to prepare to break off into an entirely new state."
