 THE_GREAT_SCHISM: "The Great Schism"
 THE_GREAT_SCHISM_DESC: "The 'Great' or 'East-West' schism was a gradual alienation between the Byzantine church and the Western rite loyal to the Papacy. While it entailed centuries of cultural and doctrinal divergences such as the Filioque controversy, July 16th 1054 marked the unprecedented mutual excommunucation of Papal legates and Patriarch Cerularius. Though the incident was soon rectified, a division in Christianity was becoming increasingly undeniable.		\n \n§G1054 is simply an early bound on start dates and is not meant to be a 'default'. Starts in the 1200s-1400s will have much more interesting Holy Roman Empire gameplay. Explore the timeline to find a scenario that interests you.§!"

 GLORY_TO_ENGLAND: "Glory to England"
 GLORY_TO_ENGLAND_DESC: "Through a marriage to Duchess Eleanor of Aquitaine, the English crown has managed to subsume a staggering portion of nominally French land. With the Capetians reduced to the heartland around Paris, King Louis VII fears the complete collapse of French power in Europe. England's forces are turned elsewhere, however - the deposed Irish lord Diarmait Mac Murchada has treacherously led a Cambro-Norman coalition into his own homeland, setting in motion 800 years of warfare."

 LATIN_EMPIRE_START: "The Latin Empire"
 LATIN_EMPIRE_START_DESC: "The notorious and ill-fated Fourth Crusade, which was supposed to retake Jerusalem after an invasion through Egypt, was instead derailed by scheming Venetians, corrupt leaders, and the deposed Byzantine Emperor Alexios IV who sought to regain his lost throne. The result was the tragic sack of Constantinople and the subsequent establishment of the so-called Latin Empire. Almost none of the Crusaders even reached the Holy Land.	 \n \nMeanwhile, the infamous King John, brother of Richard the Lionheart, rules in England, and the Christian states of Spain face off against the powerful Almohad dynasty."

 DEATH_OF_CONRAD_DESC: "On the 18th of February 1248 the Guelph forces of the Lombard League attacked the Ghibelline camp outside Parma while Emperor Friedrich II was off hunting, routing his army completely and capturing the Crown Jewels. Though Friedrich began to amass a new army in Southern Italy, the defeat inspired many more Italian states to take up arms against him, cementing the decline of the Hohenstaufen dynasty. \n \nIn the east, the more successful emperor Ioannes Batatzes of Nikaia is poised to deliver more crippling blows to Bulgaria and eventually retake the holy Byzantine capital."

 THE_BABYLONIAN_CAPTIVITY: "Babylonian Captivity"
 THE_BABYLONIAN_CAPTIVITY_DESC: "March 1309 marked the movement of the Curia under Pope Clemens V to Avignon, where subsequent Popes would reside for 67 years. The Papal proximity to the Kingdom of France allowed Philippe IV and his successors to exert considerable influence over Catholic affairs, leading the period to be laballed 'The Babylonian Captivity' after an ancient Biblical story.   \n \nHeinrich VII had recently secured the Royal German election and would soon by crowned Holy Roman Emperor after decades of Interregnum, establishing the House of Luxemburg as a powerful Imperial dynasty."

 HYW_START: "The Hundred Years War"
 HYW_START_DESC: "The death of French King Charles IV in 1328 with no immediate heir triggered a succession dispute that would last for over a hundred years. Edward III of England was the closest living male heir, but the French nobility, balking at the prospect of a foreign king, claimed the line could not pass through a woman, and crowned another pretender - Philippe. Nine years later, war broke out..."

 THE_GOLDEN_BULL: "The Golden Bull"
 THE_GOLDEN_BULL_DESC: "At the Diet of Metz, one of the most important decrees in the history of the Holy Roman Empire was issued by Emperor Karl IV. The so-called Golden Bull firmly established the Empire's electoral system by elevating seven princes to theoretically permanent privileges: Mainz, Cologne, Trier, Bohemia, Brandenburg, Saxony, and the Palatinate."

 IN_NOMINE_START: "In Nomine"
 IN_NOMINE_START_DESC: "The year is 1399 and there is turmoil everywhere. The Hundred Years War rages on in France, while the Byzantine Empire clings to just a few enclaves across thousands of miles of Islamic land. However, amongst all the chaos, scholars in Italy have effected a reinvigoration of ancient knowledge which may develop into a full-fledged paradigm shift in Western thought. Glory is there for those who can seize the opportunity..."

 OLD_ZURICH_WAR: "Old Zürich War"
 OLD_ZURICH_WAR_DESC: "When Friedrich VII von Toggenburg died without issue in 1436, his newly-carved estates were claimed by various Swiss and Swabian nobles. As bits of Toggenburger land hemorrhaged away over the next few years, the final conflict came down to the Swiss canton of Zürich versus Schwyz and Glarus. War broke out between the factions in 1440, soon drawing in powerful forces from around Europe, including the King of France and the Holy Roman Emperor himself..."

 GREEK_WAR_OF_INDEPENDENCE: "Greek War of Independence"
 GREEK_WAR_OF_INDEPENDENCE_DESC: "Greek rebels have established a Provisional Government to wage war against their Ottoman overlords. In late 1827, a series of misunderstandings led the Western peacekeeping fleets in the area to engage the Turkish navy, dealing a crippling blow and allowing the fledgeling Greek state to exand rapidly in the vacuum."

 VICTORIA_TWO: "The Grand Campaign"
 VICTORIA_TWO_DESC: "The ideals of the French Revolution were believed to have met their final demise at the hands of the Ancien Régimes of Europe. The flames of revolution may have been put out for now, but the ideas of nationalism and liberalism can never die. In this new era of unprecedented technological progress, doubts will be cast on certainties that have stood since time immemorial. Far away, across the briny foam, the riches of Anatolia and Africa beckon. Maestro, choose your instrument, and let the music play."
