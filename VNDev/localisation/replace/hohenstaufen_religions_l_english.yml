 #Descriptions
 jewish_religion_desc: "The oldest Abrahamic religion in the game, Judaism builds upon the Torah and the traditions and scriptures of the Jewish people going back over 3000 years.\nBy the start of the game the Jewish faith is a minority faith in most of the world and will only later exist in a few Polish-Lithuanian provinces."
 ibadi_religion_desc: "Ibadism is claimed by its adherents to be older than both Sunni and Shia Islam but is nowhere near as popular. The Ibadis stress strict adherence to an interpretation of Islam and the Sharia that they hold as both older and more orthodox.\nIn the game Ibadis can exist only through conversion events."
 shiite_religion_desc: "Shia Muslims hold that the legitimate successor of the prophet Muhammad as Caliph and Imam was his cousin and son-in-law Ali. The Shiites believe that a number of Imams have followed Ali and still await the coming of his final successor.\nIn the game Shia Islam is present only in minor Andalucian states."
 sunni_religion_desc: "Sunni Islam holds that the legitimate successor of the Prophet Muhammad was father-in-law Abu Bakr.\nAs the religion of the majority of the world's Muslims Sunni Islam is present from Morocco to the Levant and is one of the largest religions in the southern part of the game."
 tengri_pagan_reformed_religion_desc: "Tengri is the chief deity of one of the oldest Turkic Shamanist religions.\nIn the game this religion covers a wide variety of local Shamanistic belief systems practiced by the states that start in the west of the Eurasian steppe."
 hellenic_pagan_religion_desc: "The Hellenistic religion is polytheistic, with a pantheon of twelve major gods including Zeus, Poseidon, Hades, Aphrodite, Athena, and Hera. It originated in ancient Greece and with the conquests of Alexander the Great and the Roman Empire, it would go on to become the dominant religion in the Mediterranean world until the rise of Christendom."
 catholic_religion_desc: "Catholicism is the name of a Christian tradition with its roots in the old Latin rite that recognizes the Pope as the head of Christendom.\nIn 1054 Catholicism is the dominant Christian Church in western and northern Europe but it will likely be broken up by Protestantism and Reformism during the reformation."
 lollardy_religion_desc: "Lollardy is an early Catholic heresy originating in the teachings of Oxford theologian John Wycliffe. Wycliffe translated the Vulgate Bible into English and called for widespread reform to the Church, anticipating the Reformation centuries later. Lollardy was ubiquitous in Southern England by the 15th century despite suppression."
 anglican_religion_desc: "Anglicanism describes a specific brand of English Protestantism which originated in Henry VIII's Act of Supremacy, wherein he positioned himself at the head of the Church. While relatively moderate in reforms, the Anglican government nevertheless confiscated Monastic lands and positioned itself as a stark enemy to Catholicism for centuries to come. Anglicans may form state churches."
 bogomilist_religion_desc: "Bosanska or the 'Bosnian Church' was a branch of Christianity founded in the mid 13th century when the Pope tried to place Bosnia under the ecclesiastical jurisdiction of Hungary. Rejecting church involvement in state matters, the branch was considered a heresy by both the Catholic and Orthodox establishment. Practitioners may choose to nominally adopt a syncretic faith."
 huguenot_religion_desc: "Huguenot is a label for a type of Calvinism which exploded throughout the French region in the 16th century. Huguenots abhorred iconophilia and destroyed any kind of iconography they came across, resulting in anger from France's Catholic populations. Like the other Reformed branches, Zwinglianism and Calvinism, Huguenots may not form state churches."
 waldensian_religion_desc: "The Waldensian heresy originated in the 12th century from the teachings of Waldo of Lyon. Emphasizing scriptural adherence and apostolic poverty, the movement was quickly shunned by mainstream Catholics and reduced to a reclusive existence in the Cottian Alps."
 anabaptist_religion_desc: "So-called Anabaptists believed in delaying baptism until a person was old enough to consciously confess their faith in Christ. The movement sprung up in many areas across reformation-era Europe, but did not see as wide currency as other denominations. Anabaptists may form state churches."
 hussite_religion_desc: "Hussitism is a Catholic heresy based on the theology of the Czech priest Jan Hus, who was burned at the stake in 1415. An early attempt at reforming the church, Hussitism differed from Catholicism in its views of the role of Clergy and the Eucharist."
 zwinglianist_religion_desc: "Zwinglianism refers to a pre-Calvinist Reformed belief system based on the teachings of Swiss theologian Huldrych Zwingli. Zwingli believed that Ecclesiastic paratexts had muddled the truth of Christianity, which could only be found in scripture. Like later Calvinists, Zwinglianists will not form state churches."
 reformed_religion_desc: "Calvinism covers a wide range of religious traditions inspired by men such as Jean Calvin or John Knox. Generally appearing later than the religions clasified as Lutheran, the Calvinist religion also rejects papal authority and want to return to the rules of the scriptures but unlike the Lutherans they embrace a number of percieved more hardline ideas such as predistination and iconoclasm and will not form state churches."
 protestant_religion_desc: "Lutheranism covers a wide range of religious traditions starting with the teachings of Martin Luther during the reformation. They reacted to a number of the conventions that over time have developed in the Catholic church and the idea of a pope itself. Lutherans may form state churches."
 cathar_religion_desc: "The Cathar, or Albigensian, heresy rejects confession and the holiness of the clergy and of the Pope. They only have a single sacrament - the Consolation - to remove sin and turn the believer into a Cathar 'Perfect'."
 fraticelli_religion_desc: "The Fraticelli, or 'Little Brethren', is a Catholic heresy that originated in the Fransiscan Order of monks. It is devoted to poverty and asceticism - especially for men of the cloth. Fraticelli heretics are violently opposed to Church wealth and displays of opulence."
 animism_religion_desc: "The polytheistic branch of Paganism practiced by the Baltic and Prussian natives. The faith was allegedly headed by a high priest called Kriwe who dictated religious matters from the great temple Romuva and conducted nature and ancestor worship. Practitioners may choose to adopt a personal deity."
 paulician_religion_desc: "Paulicianism is named for the third century bishop Paul of Samosata, a gnostic adoptionist who was a contemporary of Manichaeus. Though originally popular in Armenia and the Eastern front of the Byzantine Empire, the religion relocated to Bulgaria in the 10th century."
 norse_pagan_reformed_religion_desc: "Norse religion is the polytheistic traditional belief system of the Scandinavian peoples.\nBy 1054 the Norse religion was relegated to obscure backwaters in Sweden as the rest of the southern population had largely converted."
 slavic_pagan_religion_desc: "Slavic religion is polytheistic, the chief god being Perun, god of thunder and lightning, quite similar to the Germanic god Thor. Other important deities include Veles, god of the underworld, Svarog, Jarilo, and Dazbog. In addition, many tribes revere local gods."
